1667
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,760
It was given to the executive to

1668
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,000
control them, and the monetary variables were

1669
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
given to the central bank to

1670
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,239
control them. And also, we handed over the

1671
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,880
central bank to the independence

1672
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,679
of of private parties, that don't listen

1673
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,480
to the executive. Well, why? Why was

1674
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:02,440
that need made? So that the central

1675
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,000
bank introduces money to

1676
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,679
through banks. So, the

1677
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,480
process comes: the central bank makes

1678
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,960
the money, delivers it to the banks, and

1679
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,719
the banks lend it to

1680
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:19,440
government. When we could make the money

1681
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,320
directly, give it to government, without

1682
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,320
need for so much intermediation or so much interest

1683
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,480
rate.

1684
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,320
We've already seen how money works.

1685
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:34,040
So, why did central banks

1686
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,440
ask for independence? Well of course,

1687
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,159
you can't imagine the business that

1688
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,679
moves when we do this. No, the

1689
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:43,719
central banks, with control of the

1690
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:46,960
money supply and interest rate, and

1691
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,960
indebting government, and when they indebt

1692
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,080
government, the go, the executive, to

1693
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,719
be able to pay, well indebts everyone,

1694
01:17:55,719 --> 01:17:56,920
with

1695
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,920
taxes. That's the procedure that

1696
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,639
we must reject, and that we must change

1697
01:18:02,639 --> 01:18:05,040
for the new era of human

1698
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,840
liberation. We have to reject that process

1699
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,120
that enslaves, and do our own,

1700
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,239
directly. The central bank,

1701
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:16,560
really, should be a wing of

1702
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,199
government, where government makes the

1703
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:22,960
money the economy needs,

1704
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,520
directly, without credit, without interest, and

1705
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:29,000
distributes it to the economy, puts it into

1706
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,960
circulation through the works of the

1707
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,159
executive, of infrastructure

1708
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:37,400
works, or through its

1709
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,080
different control bodies, that can

1710
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,000
help the different companies.

1711
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,760
And banking, how does it benefit from all

1712
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,159
this? In that government, when it receives

1713
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,400
money, government will use

1714
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,600
banking, anyway. It'll put the

1715
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,280
money in banking, and banking will be able to

1716
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,960
distribute and lend to private parties,

1717
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,840
but not indebting government or the

1718
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,840
country directly. So, what happened with

1719
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:08,199
our system when we separated it?

1720
01:19:08,199 --> 01:19:10,880
We committed a very big sin, because the

1721
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,880
system is one. The system must be unique,

1722
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,719
and all countries can do this

1723
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:20,400
situation: reunite this, recover

1724
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,000
their central banks,

1725
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,960
and eliminate debt.

1726
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,239
Well, I'd like to make an introduction of

1727
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,880
what would be,

1728
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,440
then, the unique money on planet

1729
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,080
Earth, under the same

1730
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,560
principle. Let's say, then, that this isn't

1731
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,760
a country, but that it's planet Earth,

1732
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:47,000
where we have an

1733
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,320
executive, the different sectors of the

1734
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,480
economy, and some control ones. Well it

1735
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:58,480
means that the bank, no longer central,

1736
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,600
but at world level, we should

1737
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,520
have a single bank. But a single bank

1738
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:07,080
that wouldn't belong to any particular

1739
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,920
country, nor to any particular

1740
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,199
entity. It would belong to all

1741
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:15,280
countries. Let's say all countries

1742
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,760
could meet and make a single bank, and

1743
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:22,320
that single bank would have to make an

1744
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,840
annual distribution of money, change

1745
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,520
in all countries the money for that

1746
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,639
single currency. That single bank would have to

1747
01:20:31,639 --> 01:20:36,000
give money each year to the new, to the

1748
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,800
countries, not as

1749
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,600
debt, but as: this is the equity that

1750
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,400
corresponds to you to spend

1751
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,880
this year, to increase your production in

1752
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,560
this year. And all countries could go

1753
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,760
tied to a, to a single inter-

1754
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,280
national currency, but with that equitable factor

1755
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,239
of giving each one their

1756
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:01,719
corresponding monetary unit each

1757
01:21:01,719 --> 01:21:04,280
year, so they keep growing. And thus

1758
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,040
we could establish a new economic

1759
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,800
system

1760
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,600
worldwide. How far could this be?

1761
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,320
Well, it depends on on how quickly

1762
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,960
each country organizes, first,

1763
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,320
individually,

1764
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:23,880
so people level out, level out

1765
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,600
in the, in the

1766
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,480
socioeconomic, we all have a

1767
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,120
balanced level of of life, and then, yes,

1768
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,159
we could proceed to make the unique

1769
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:36,760
integrated system

1770
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,120
international. And in that way, perhaps,

1771
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,960
legislation could be unified,

1772
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,840
being equitable for for everyone. We've

1773
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:52,920
finished the talk. It's Economic

1774
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,600
Heresy, Protocols Toward a New

1775
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,800
Economic System. It depends on you

1776
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,880
to allow them not to keep stealing, not to

1777
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,440
keep exploiting, not to

1778
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,040
keep on. Well, it depends on you to win

1779
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:15,040
the new planet Earth, with the

1780
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,960
abundance we deserve, with the

1781
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,719
happiness we deserve. This is a

1782
01:22:19,719 --> 01:22:22,280
new scientific and systemic method for

1783
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:25,239
economic theory. This is the first

1784
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:27,719
chapter of the book "Protocols Toward a

1785
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:33,080
New Economic System". You were

1786
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:39,000
addressed by Mauricio Rivadeneira Mora. It was a

1787
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,440
pleasure.
