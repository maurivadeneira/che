2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,480
We're going to present

3
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:17,960
Economic Heresy in the current context.

4
00:00:17,960 --> 00:00:20,119
We can say we're going to have two

5
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:22,519
theories. I want us to separate two

6
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:25,000
theories and we're going to put the one

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,599
that everyone generally knows aside,

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,519
and for some reason, we're going to

9
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,719
forget about that theory, because what

10
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm going to present to you is a new context

11
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:38,520
for how we study economic

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,239
theory again. Current events

13
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:45,000
are indicating that we are

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,199
very defenseless. Crises catch us and

15
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:52,520
turn us around and spin us, and

16
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:54,399
apparently we know a lot, but we

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:56,960
know nothing because we're being hit.

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,359
So I want to tell you

19
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,960
that if you come, you have the

20
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,799
fortune to come listen to this

21
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,720
conference before that great

22
00:01:07,720 --> 00:01:10,520
cataclysm occurs that seems to be coming,

23
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,320
perhaps you can understand a

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,560
bit and help prevent such a

25
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:17,759
situation. If the

26
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,640
situation occurs and you know this

27
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:23,000
conference afterwards, at least you'll understand

28
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,320
why those events happened, what

29
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:28,439
occurred. And but let's hope we

30
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:31,240
can do it beforehand. So

31
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:33,159
Economic Heresy is going to be the new

32
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,280
context I'm going to present. Economic

33
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,720
Heresy will fundamentally rethink

34
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,280
the theory. We're going to rebuild it,

35
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:44,759
we're going to make it scientific, because the

36
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:47,640
problem with economic theory is

37
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:49,719
that it doesn't have a scientific

38
00:01:49,719 --> 00:01:51,960
context. My name is Mauricio

39
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,039
Rivadeneira Mora. For you, I'm a physicist

40
00:01:56,039 --> 00:01:57,280
and

41
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:00,439
economist. And we're going to

42
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:03,240
say then that Economic Heresy is

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,719
based on the book. Coming soon

44
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:08,720
"Protocols Toward a New Economic

45
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,080
System." "Protocols Toward a New

46
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:13,319
Economic System" develops a new

47
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:15,599
scientific and systemic method for

48
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,400
economic theory. Before

49
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,080
knowing this book, you can

50
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,760
find writings about it on the

59
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,040
[Music]

60
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:55,800
@yahoo.es. Economics lacks a scientific

61
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,680
method. Still far from the truth, it must

62
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:02,120
be questioned without fear, because if

63
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,599
today's society is lost, it's not by

64
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,959
design of the gods, but by the

65
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,120
hand of man himself, by the fragility

66
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,120
of his thinking, by the rigidity of his

67
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,920
beliefs. That's why I invite you to

68
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:19,680
set aside, let's forget at this

69
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:22,080
moment what you know and

70
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,239
let's begin a new way of thinking about

71
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:29,360
theory. Could we build a utopia?

72
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,239
We can currently think

73
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:34,360
of a utopia, a new world with a

74
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:37,959
new theory. Could we believe in an

75
00:03:37,959 --> 00:03:41,040
ideal country where there's no inflation, where

76
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,040
no country has debts, where everyone

77
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,280
can work, there are no poor people,

78
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,239
we're all rich, money is

79
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,599
unlimited, capitalism exists, and everyone

80
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:52,599
has social security?

81
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:55,519
I tell you that in our paradigms and

82
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:57,840
in the knowledge we have today in

83
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,120
current economic theory, no one would

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,480
dare say this is

85
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,840
possible. Our paradigms tell us

86
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,799
this is

87
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:09,400
impossible.

88
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,239
Economic Heresy wants to tell you

89
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,879
some reasons that justify

90
00:04:15,879 --> 00:04:18,320
questioning the theory we know

91
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,959
today. First and fundamental: that half

92
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:25,479
of the world's population is in

93
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,199
poverty. Second: we approach

94
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,400
reality through theories and models.

95
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:34,800
In economics, we make models that we then

96
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:37,320
impose on reality. We don't look for the

97
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,320
best model that interprets

98
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:42,160
reality. In synthesis, we don't seek

99
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:45,280
reality. Something is

100
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,520
failing. Three: the method we use

101
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:50,240
is closer to mathematics than

102
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:52,720
to physics. Mathematics

103
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,840
allows us to create models independent of

104
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:57,680
reality. Physics, on the other hand,

105
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:59,840
forces us to find the constraints that

106
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,759
reality imposes on us, and both are

107
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:06,880
logical. Four: inflation, we must

108
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:09,440
know why it occurs. In general,

109
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,039
when a phenomenon is known, when

110
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,720
we know the law that produces that

111
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:16,000
phenomenon, we can control it. However,

112
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,840
inflation continues

113
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,319
to occur.

114
00:05:22,319 --> 00:05:24,479
Fifth: continuing with the reasons that

115
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:26,360
justify questioning the theory we have

116
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,759
today in economics, we have

117
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:31,880
paradigms or fully

118
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:34,039
established beliefs. Example: that if the government

119
00:05:34,039 --> 00:05:36,840
issues money, inflation occurs. I

120
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,240
want to tell you that I personally have

121
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,880
heard many explanations, but

122
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,680
I've never seen at least one study

123
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,840
where this statement can be confirmed.

124
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,680
No studies exist. They haven't been done.

125
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,800
Sixth: someone issues money, because

126
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,759
someone is giving money to the system.

127
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,680
Then it means someone is

128
00:05:56,680 --> 00:05:59,000
issuing it, and what we say is

129
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,960
that if the government does it, it produces

130
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:03,639
inflation, but if private

131
00:06:03,639 --> 00:06:06,840
parties do it, no. There's no

132
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,560
consistency.

133
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:11,840
Seventh: the Central Bank in all

134
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:15,160
countries of the world today has the duty to

135
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,919
control inflation. Now, if it succeeds,

136
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,080
fine, but if not, then the fault is the

137
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,000
government's, which is spending too much.

138
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,960
Notice that this isn't

139
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,560
consistent. Eighth: we open ourselves to an

140
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,520
accepted globalization. We have no way

141
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,639
to measure its results or to

142
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:37,800
simulate or predict its feasibility. We

143
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,520
don't even know if it's possible, but we

144
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:43,319
accept it without

145
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,039
hesitation.

146
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,039
Ninth: our economic theory

147
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:50,120
begins with a fundamental

148
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:53,759
postulate: resources are limited.

149
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:55,879
Hence the results: half the

150
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,720
population in poverty, all countries

151
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,360
fighting for resources with other

152
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:02,319
countries,

153
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:05,280
war. And all these are

154
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,800
elements that originate from the belief

155
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,160
that resources are limited. And there

156
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:13,000
our theory begins. That's the

157
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,960
fundamental principle of the theory we

158
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,840
have today. We're going to radically change

159
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:19,000
that principle.

160
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,800
Tenth: however, reality seems

161
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:25,360
to be different. Resources are unlimited. Indeed,

162
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,800
the sun gives us practically

163
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:30,280
unlimited energy. The sea and its

164
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,360
waves provide us indefinite energy.

165
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,520
Nanotechnology gives us a dimension

166
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,319
of infinite possibilities, etcetera.

167
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:42,319
Money, I want to tell you, can also be

168
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:44,879
made in any amount you want or

169
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,919
require, without

170
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:50,759
restrictions.

171
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:54,879
Well, I want to talk to you then now

172
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:57,440
about the context of economic theory. How

173
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,599
should we conceive it

174
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:04,080
today? A theory is composed of

175
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,039
laws and principles. In economics, the

176
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:10,919
practical part, the one that would lead us to say

177
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,879
what we should do, leads us, conducts us

178
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,479
to economic

179
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,479
policies. And those economic policies,

180
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,039
once we apply them, where do we

181
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:23,720
apply them? In institutions, where we

182
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,919
set goals and objectives, so

183
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:30,159
that the total context of

184
00:08:30,159 --> 00:08:33,440
theory cannot be solely economic

185
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,039
policies, it cannot be only

186
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:40,120
institutional. We cannot say that

187
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:43,480
econometrics is not an

188
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,640
integration between laws, our

189
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,959
principles, our knowledge of

190
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:53,880
law developed through

191
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,160
economic policies that we apply. Then,

192
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:00,600
here we measure the results. Economic

193
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,440
theory must be able to

194
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:06,800
be measured. If we don't measure, if we don't verify

195
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,399
results experimentally, we're

196
00:09:09,399 --> 00:09:11,839
not talking about a scientific

197
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,560
theory. So we have to

198
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:16,700
be able to interrelate both

199
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,600
[Music]

200
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:24,720
aspects: our experimental test and

201
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,240
feedback, and between one and the other

202
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,440
block. We cannot say that

203
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,800
economic theory we have, that changing

204
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:34,440
all institutions, makes no sense.

205
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,399
Institutions evolve with

206
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:40,120
man, with eras,

207
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,240
over time. So

208
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,959
economics isn't institutions, it's not

209
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:48,279
just economic policies. Economic

210
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:50,720
policies must be able to be

211
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,360
contrasted in

212
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,680
practice. And if what we expect equals

213
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,600
the result, then we can say we're

214
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:00,160
doing well.

215
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:01,880
But if we say we're going to

216
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:04,200
implement globalization according to

217
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,959
our principles, and then we apply

218
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:09,000
policies, neoliberal

219
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,600
policies, and the result is everything

220
00:10:11,600 --> 00:10:14,240
collapses, well, it's not congruent,

221
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:16,760
because we did that to

222
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,880
be able to evolve and to move

223
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,800
forward, and everything is collapsing.

224
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,000
It means something is failing. But

225
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,279
what? How can we know what's

226
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,320
failing? So that problem,

227
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,680
we must be able to solve with the theory

228
00:10:30,680 --> 00:10:33,079
we're building. So,

229
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:36,560
let's develop each of these

230
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:40,160
points. Let's look first at laws and

231
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:42,720
principles. Knowledge of law is

232
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:44,360
generated in the discourse of economic

233
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:46,200
theory.

234
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:49,959
This discourse, in a way, I'll put

235
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:53,160
nine equations here, not all of which we'll

236
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,120
accept. Nine equations that

237
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,360
somehow have already been

238
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:00,959
given in economics, but here we compile them. You

239
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,839
won't find them integrated anywhere,

240
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:06,200
but I'll show you basically

241
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:08,120
the equations we

242
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,880
have. I won't develop this

243
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:13,560
in detail right now. This is

244
00:11:13,560 --> 00:11:15,680
just a conference to give you an

245
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,079
introduction. You can read it later in

246
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:21,279
the book. Economists know

247
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:25,279
this as income, the income Y,

248
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:28,240
people consume it or save it, but

249
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,440
when we speak in these terms,

250
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,959
I want you to understand it's in a country.

251
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,920
This is macro dimension. This isn't at an

252
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,519
individual level. People

253
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,560
consume, and this should have been called

254
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,680
balance, and let's leave balance there for

255
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,160
now. There's a second

256
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:49,680
equation of ingenuity. Product of

257
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:51,880
Keynes's ingenuity, he deciphered these

258
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:54,839
equations for economics, in which

259
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:57,480
production, which he also called Y, equal

260
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:00,760
to income, production occurs

261
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:02,880
in production of consumer goods or in

262
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:06,200
production of investment

263
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:10,680
goods. He called it Y also because

264
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:13,040
they turn out to be equal. What people

265
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:15,360
produce generates income for

266
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,760
people, and so they're identified. They're

267
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,680
equal. Since people's consumption is

268
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:24,519
equal to consumer goods, savings,

269
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,720
which is, or the balance people have, is

270
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,839
what's dedicated to investment. Investment

271
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,160
in what? When you make a company,

272
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,560
you invest in capital

273
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:38,399
goods and working

274
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,399
capital. Really, only those two

275
00:12:41,399 --> 00:12:43,320
are where investment stays. So

276
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,839
what we say, that savings equals

277
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:48,320
investment, means that

278
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:51,199
investment is all in inventory,

279
00:12:51,199 --> 00:12:53,920
generally in accounts or machinery,

280
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:55,959
new equipment emerging into the

281
00:12:55,959 --> 00:12:59,399
economy. Keynes realized that the

282
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:02,480
system, that this part was a real part.

283
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,240
This is measurable. This is how a country's

284
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:07,160
gross domestic product is measured.

285
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:10,560
Keynes realized that for this, money

286
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,760
existed. He spoke of supply and

287
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,320
demand for money. We speak,

288
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,639
let's say, only of money, and

289
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:22,199
money was expressed as M1 and M2, and in

290
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:25,600
some contexts they put up to M4 and

291
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,360
even more. Really, the fundamental one is

292
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:32,320
the money supply, and this is the most

293
00:13:32,320 --> 00:13:35,160
important:

294
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:38,560
M1, the money you have so these

295
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,959
products circulate and generate people's

296
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:43,480
income. So notice, as

297
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:46,480
if it were, as if we were talking about a

298
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,399
theory at the scientific level, at the

299
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:51,320
physical level, let's talk about a unified

300
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:53,800
theory. Economics must be looked at in

301
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,120
its context. What this invites us to,

302
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:58,440
when we put it this way, is that

303
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:01,000
we're talking about a unified

304
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:04,680
theory, a system. It's very

305
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:06,480
important to understand this is a

306
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,040
system.

307
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,000
So

308
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,600
money, when we make the

309
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,440
ratio Y over M, we then invent

310
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:20,560
the the interrelation that exists

311
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,920
in those two blocks: income and

312
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:26,880
production, which combines with money

313
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,720
so products circulate, and

314
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:31,360
we then have the definition of

315
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:34,199
velocity of money circulation. That

316
00:14:34,199 --> 00:14:36,079
velocity of money circulation, and

317
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:38,199
this can already be expressed as an

318
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:41,000
equation. Even though economic

319
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:44,399
theory from there, the one everyone knows,

320
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,800
says this isn't an equation, but

321
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:49,360
an identity, in our context we're

322
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,040
going to effectively work with it as an

323
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,079
equation. We can express it, then,

324
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:55,480
move M to multiply on the other side, and

325
00:14:55,480 --> 00:14:58,199
say Y equals V times M. That is, the

326
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,279
gross domestic product, or

327
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,560
production, is related to the

328
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,279
velocity of money circulation and

329
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:06,959
to the money supply of the

330
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,160
system. So notice, our

331
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:12,920
immediate first conclusion: if we want

332
00:15:12,920 --> 00:15:17,279
gross domestic product to increase,

333
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:20,440
we have to increase the money

334
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:23,240
supply. This is going to tell us, notice,

335
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:24,959
we're going to start clashing with the

336
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:30,959
concepts from the previous theory.

337
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:34,639
That if we make emissions, let's not talk

338
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,240
yet about whether inflation will be

339
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,240
generated, but that emissions are needed

340
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:40,120
for gross domestic product to

341
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,800
increase. From this expression,

342
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:46,519
replacing Y with prices times

343
00:15:46,519 --> 00:15:50,199
quantities, P times Q, is the quantity of

344
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:52,480
volume sold in an economy at

345
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:55,759
a given moment, it's an indicator of

346
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,920
production. Prices times quantities,

347
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,720
so we have that prices times

348
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:05,759
quantities equals V times M. From this

349
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:07,480
equation, which was called the quantitative

350
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:11,519
equation of money, it was

351
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,440
concluded that if M increased,

352
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:17,519
prices increased. Well, that's an

353
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:20,279
interpretation that's been given to it

354
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,959
throughout history, and that's

355
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,040
evolved throughout history.

356
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:28,199
Before it was said that if M increased more

357
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:31,120
rapidly than Q, inflation occurred.

358
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:34,160
In the new texts we have today, it's

359
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,000
said that if M increases, P increases

360
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,480
immediately. Why? Because Q

361
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,560
varies very little, and because V, the

362
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,880
velocity of circulation, are also practically

363
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:48,959
constant at an instant in time. But

364
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,240
that's a bad interpretation, because

365
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,319
we have to look at this over the

366
00:16:53,319 --> 00:16:56,160
course of a year, not when when

367
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,240
the time limit tends to zero.

368
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:02,519
We'll look at it later. When I look at it

369
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:04,679
over a year, in a year, what happens? One

370
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,679
has to increase the money

371
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:11,480
supply to the extent that Q increases,

372
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:13,679
and there we try to keep prices

373
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:14,839
constant.

374
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,480
When we have this over the year,

375
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:20,919
it means that if we go to time t equals

376
00:17:20,919 --> 00:17:24,360
0, that is, in day to day, on the day of

377
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,919
today, so to speak, the emission will be

378
00:17:27,919 --> 00:17:31,000
1/365th of what I'm going to do in

379
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,720
the year, that is, it'll be a very

380
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,559
small thing, and so, speaking in

381
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:36,280
small terms, a very small thing

382
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,400
won't modify this, but will modify

383
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:41,120
production. Production

384
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,640
daily is

385
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,640
growing or slowing, but

386
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,679
depending on how you handle

387
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:51,000
money. These equations were expressed by

388
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,880
Keynes, and Keynes, well, did more. He did,

389
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,640
he spoke of a fifth, which I maintain

390
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,280
isn't necessary to handle, because

391
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,080
about this, what it does is muddy the

392
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:05,919
discourse a bit. He spoke of another

393
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,559
proposition, that the marginal

394
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:09,120
efficiency of capital reaches the point where it

395
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,720
equals the interest rate. I

396
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,000
add with the deposit

397
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,159
interest rate, it's my addition. Keynes reached

398
00:18:15,159 --> 00:18:18,000
here, up to the interest rate.

399
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:21,080
Keynes spoke a lot about the interest

400
00:18:21,080 --> 00:18:24,039
rate, but never expressed it as deposit

401
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:25,640
interest rate of the financial

402
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:28,039
system plus the intermediation

403
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:30,960
interest rate of the financial system. That

404
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,919
he only spoke of the interest rate, in my

405
00:18:32,919 --> 00:18:35,960
view, he fell short. It was necessary to

406
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,080
open the expression and analyze them one by

407
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,919
one. But he spoke of the interest rate.

408
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,760
I add this other equation for the

409
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:47,480
same context: that sales, in general,

410
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:51,480
global, in an economy, equal

411
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:54,480
P times Q, almost what we were talking about here. Not

412
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:57,320
exactly, but it's like, like like in

413
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,679
GDP. A social P, let's speak of a social

414
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,360
GDP, where sales will

415
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:05,840
equal costs, plus expenses, plus

416
00:19:05,840 --> 00:19:09,880
interest, plus taxes, plus

417
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,440
profits. Or removing from those sales

418
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:15,440
all these expenses, we're left with the

419
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,520
social profits of the entire system. And

420
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,960
I'd add a following equation, which

421
00:19:21,960 --> 00:19:24,360
is like a result of the management that

422
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,799
happens here, which is that inflation

423
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:30,799
depends on costs, on the money

424
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:33,840
supply, and particularly, within those

425
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,039
costs, on the deposit

426
00:19:36,039 --> 00:19:39,400
interest rate. It's fundamental in the theoretical

427
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:42,039
context we're going to look at here, in this

428
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:45,159
context. Keynes said the following. Keynes

429
00:19:45,159 --> 00:19:47,360
analyzed this as a

430
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:50,840
system, and said: gentlemen, look carefully,

431
00:19:50,840 --> 00:19:53,120
all the variables are there. When I

432
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:57,039
speak of income, production,

433
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:59,240
consumption, I can break this down as

434
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,120
household consumption or government

435
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,919
consumption. I'm talking about all the

436
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:05,320
variables, the money supply,

437
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,760
supply and demand for products,

438
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:09,400
supply and demand for savings and

439
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,440
investment, supply and

440
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:15,520
demand in general. And Keynes made an

441
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:18,480
analysis. Keynes wanted to know what were

442
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,480
the independent variables of that

443
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,679
system. When he said: what were the

444
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:25,320
independent variables of the system,

445
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,760
he wanted to know how the

446
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:30,480
system could be managed. Where was the secret

447
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,400
to managing the system? And he discovered

448
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,880
that the independent variables of the

449
00:20:35,880 --> 00:20:38,960
system were the money supply and the

450
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,280
interest rate. And we're going to handle

451
00:20:42,280 --> 00:20:45,520
this discourse very well. Notice that

452
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,960
in current theory, we're told

453
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:50,840
that if the money supply increases,

454
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,600
inflation occurs. I'm going to contradict

455
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:56,280
that later. And it tells us that if

456
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,840
the interest rate increases,

457
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,240
we can control inflation.

458
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:03,760
I'm also going to contradict that

459
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,640
point, but I won't contradict it,

460
00:21:05,640 --> 00:21:07,960
you'll realize yourselves

461
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,640
that it's

462
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:14,559
false. When Keynes said these two were

463
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,880
the independent variables of the system,

464
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:19,840
it means whoever manages these two

465
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,880
variables manages the entire economy,

466
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,880
invariably.

467
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,120
When we separated and gave to the

468
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:31,720
central banks so they manage

469
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,640
the money supply and interest rate, and

470
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:38,320
the government manages the the product, the

471
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,279
gross domestic product, and production, and

472
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:44,000
consumption, and regulates, then,

473
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,159
employment, we made, we committed a very

474
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:49,840
big sin, which was to divide the system. The

475
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:52,720
system is indivisible. The system is one

476
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:56,000
single thing, and everything works in perfect unity.

477
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:58,880
When we divided it, we told some

478
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:01,520
gentlemen: manage this. We gave

479
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,840
all the power of the economic system to

480
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:06,200
some people to manage. We gave it

481
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,600
to the central banks, because at

482
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,880
this moment the central banks, all

483
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:13,520
in the world, manage these two

484
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:16,039
variables, and we gave them

485
00:22:16,039 --> 00:22:18,320
independence from the government. So,

486
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,440
it means that independence is

487
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,880
inclined, rather, toward management by

488
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,400
private interests. I want to tell you, with

489
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:27,520
this, that here we're seeing that we have

490
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,120
to rejoin

491
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:31,840
the money supply and the interest rate

492
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:34,559
so the government manages it, as the

493
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,279
social element it is and that represents

494
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:40,799
the community in general, and not

495
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:44,039
private interests. Well, in this

496
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:45,760
context, this is the development I

497
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,080
wanted to discuss right now.

498
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:50,039
We'll develop this a bit more later,

499
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:52,080
but in a visual way so everyone

500
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:54,279
can understand, and right now I'll

501
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:57,880
leave it at that point. We're going to

502
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:00,480
continue, then, with our second

503
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,720
part: economic policies. Notice

504
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:04,679
we're giving them separately, and

505
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,760
then we'll

506
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:09,200
interrelate them. So, the second

507
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:12,120
part tells us: economic policies. I'm

508
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:14,760
going to talk to you, in general, about eight

509
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:18,760
policies. I only chose these eight,

510
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:21,240
although the most important are three. No,

511
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,720
more, I chose these eight, because they're the ones that

512
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,799
define the macroeconomic system for me in

513
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,240
broad strokes.

514
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:31,559
There are many more policies, because

515
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:34,080
every country goes on developing

516
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,799
employment policies later, social

517
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,840
security policies, policies for

518
00:23:40,840 --> 00:23:44,000
agricultural development, for all

519
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:45,919
fields. In all fields, in all

520
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:48,480
three sectors of the economy. But

521
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,840
with these eight, in

522
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:54,600
general, we define the general context of

523
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:59,000
a country. How a country should be managed.

524
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,279
So, we talk about the free

525
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:04,080
market, for example, and the free market

526
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,279
can, at a given

527
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,919
moment, define, we define as

528
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:13,240
policy that we don't have free market, or

529
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:16,159
that we do have free market, or a combined

530
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:18,080
range,

531
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,279
right. Tariffs, we can say no,

532
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:24,480
that we don't have them, or that we do. Interest

533
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,240
rates, similarly, we have a very large

534
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:30,159
range to choose a defined

535
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:32,919
policy. So, let's see, for example, what

536
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,200
the International Monetary

537
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,399
Fund tells us about free market. It

538
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:39,360
tells us we have to apply it 100%.

539
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:41,399
About tariffs, it tells us we have

540
00:24:41,399 --> 00:24:43,880
to eliminate tariffs, and well, that

541
00:24:43,880 --> 00:24:46,720
has its explanation, which to all of us seems

542
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,320
reasonable.

543
00:24:48,320 --> 00:24:50,399
We should eliminate

544
00:24:50,399 --> 00:24:52,399
tariffs so more free

545
00:24:52,399 --> 00:24:54,679
trade is generated, which helps lower

546
00:24:54,679 --> 00:24:56,640
prices, competition helps prices

547
00:24:56,640 --> 00:24:59,840
drop, and and countries thus

548
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,760
benefit from being able to acquire

549
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:04,200
cheaper things. About interest

550
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:05,399
rates, they

551
00:25:05,399 --> 00:25:08,240
tell us it's better if they're high so

552
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:11,039
that, so that countries attract

553
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,880
external capital, attract foreign

554
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,640
investment. It tells us that fiscal

555
00:25:17,640 --> 00:25:21,360
deficit we should eliminate.

556
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:25,320
The IMF is International Monetary Fund. What

557
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:28,440
they sold us with globalization

558
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,240
are the policies that define

559
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:32,159
globalization for us. So, that fiscal

560
00:25:32,159 --> 00:25:34,200
deficit we should eliminate. What does

561
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:37,720
that mean? That governments equal

562
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,600
their current income they have with

563
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:44,600
their expenses, that it doesn't go into debt. This, this,

564
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:47,520
we need to see if that's possible to do in

565
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:50,240
practice, in reality. They told us

566
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,320
it had to be done, but no, they never

567
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,720
gave us an analysis of whether that was

568
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:57,120
possible or not, and people believe it's

569
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:59,480
possible, but that's, that's the

570
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:02,200
challenge. They told us, then, that if we didn't

571
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,039
manage to maintain a fiscal deficit,

572
00:26:05,039 --> 00:26:07,440
we'd have to go into debt.

573
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,799
So, these two are combined. The

574
00:26:10,799 --> 00:26:13,279
debt, then, must be generated. If

575
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:15,720
this doesn't happen, there'll be

576
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:19,000
debt. Money issuance, that

577
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:21,399
is, the Central Bank making money

578
00:26:21,399 --> 00:26:23,200
for the government, so the government

579
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,120
spends it, that these emissions

580
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:27,360
shouldn't be made, and they told us very clearly

581
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:29,480
that because that caused inflation. You

582
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,679
remember I told you already that that

583
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:33,360
inflation we still didn't have very clear

584
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:35,760
what caused it. They tell us that

585
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:38,360
inflation is caused by that money

586
00:26:38,360 --> 00:26:41,480
emission, and that it shouldn't be done, and in fact,

587
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,159
it's prohibited in the entire world. Even in

588
00:26:43,159 --> 00:26:45,320
the United States, we'll see how that

589
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:47,120
provision makes countries,

590
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,600
inevitably, reach a crisis.

591
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,480
But we'll see it

592
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,279
later. Taxes, they tell us: well, if

593
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,240
not to have to go into debt, then

594
00:26:57,240 --> 00:26:59,880
we have to collect more taxes, and

595
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:02,960
taxes should be high. And then,

596
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:05,159
to be able to pay those deficits, it's better to

597
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,440
privatize the entire economy, privatize

598
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:11,960
public services, oil,

599
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:15,559
privatize absolutely all the the

600
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:18,600
the elements, companies the

601
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:20,440
government has.

602
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:24,799
Well. But, but notice well, this is a

603
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,399
combination of many possible,

604
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,679
undoubtedly. When they told us

605
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:33,399
globalization, that had to be proven

606
00:27:33,399 --> 00:27:36,080
first that that's the best

607
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,480
way. They never proved anything to us. They

608
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:40,760
told us: do this, and the world went

609
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,200
headfirst to do that, and today we're

610
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,880
suffering consequences, and we don't

611
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,360
know why. We're going to try to see

612
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:50,760
what happens. But right now, what I

613
00:27:50,760 --> 00:27:52,840
want to see with this table is that

614
00:27:52,840 --> 00:27:56,240
we analyze other possibilities for

615
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,000
the same globalization, because, indeed,

616
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:01,519
the that combination of policies, well, there are

617
00:28:01,519 --> 00:28:03,399
many possibilities. I want to

618
00:28:03,399 --> 00:28:06,640
show you what

619
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:11,440
Keynes said. Keynes spoke of the free

620
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:13,159
market, yes, but with some

621
00:28:13,159 --> 00:28:17,880
restrictions. That is, not so 100%, all the way.

622
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,320
He told us that tariffs,

623
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,960
you had to be a bit careful with

624
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:25,480
tariffs to protect the internal

625
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,320
market a bit. So, not very high,

626
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:30,600
but, but you did have to put certain

627
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,960
tariffs. About interest rates, in

628
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,799
Keynes, definitely, interest

629
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:37,399
rates should always be low. That

630
00:28:37,399 --> 00:28:39,919
was very clear in his theoretical context.

631
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:43,440
About fiscal deficit, Keynes understood

632
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:45,919
that government was an essential engine

633
00:28:45,919 --> 00:28:48,760
for

634
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:51,760
that, that, that engine to move the

635
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,799
economy. So, fiscal deficit, yes,

636
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,799
had to exist. He understood that the State's

637
00:28:56,799 --> 00:28:59,080
mere income isn't sufficient,

638
00:28:59,080 --> 00:29:01,640
but the State has to be an

639
00:29:01,640 --> 00:29:04,279
engine in spending so the economy

640
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:06,880
is is activated. We'll see it

641
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,480
later, a bit clearer. The

642
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:12,080
debt, in Keynes, is very clear,

643
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,960
it has to happen. That is, Keynes doesn't speak of

644
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,640
free money emissions. He doesn't speak of

645
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,279
very restricted money emissions,

646
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,519
but debt has to occur.

647
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:28,200
That he always saw banking as very, very

648
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:30,039
important. He could never

649
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:33,279
break free from debt. Our

650
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,320
current civilization is the civilization

651
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:38,880
of debt. We're all used to

652
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:41,240
having to resort to debt. I'm

653
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:44,840
going to tell you it's not necessarily

654
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:48,120
true. About money issuance, Keynes:

655
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:49,320
it should happen,

656
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,000
indeed. Not much. Taxes, in

657
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:55,720
Keynes, shouldn't be so high. They should be just

658
00:29:55,720 --> 00:29:58,760
regulated. And about privatizations, he's

659
00:29:58,760 --> 00:30:01,320
not very much in agreement, Keynes. Keynes

660
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,559
understands that part of the

661
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:06,880
State's function is is to provide service in

662
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:10,240
those places where private

663
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,399
parties aren't, aren't, aren't very sociable to do

664
00:30:14,399 --> 00:30:18,600
that kind of work. Well, as

665
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:21,159
you see, look, there's another possible

666
00:30:21,159 --> 00:30:23,760
combination, and I want to show you that there

667
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,679
are still many more combinations, and

668
00:30:26,679 --> 00:30:28,480
I'm going to show you one more. You'll

669
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,320
be shocked with

670
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:38,320
this. Globalization, for example, according to a

671
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,399
new model. Maybe I can

672
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:42,399
prove to you that this, that this other

673
00:30:42,399 --> 00:30:44,440
possibility is much better than the two

674
00:30:44,440 --> 00:30:47,039
previous ones. One in which free

675
00:30:47,039 --> 00:30:50,000
market, we don't have free market. That is,

676
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,200
I accept free market. I think the

677
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:55,080
free market is the best of

678
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:58,360
systems to bring to

679
00:30:58,360 --> 00:31:00,519
civilization all possible elements of

680
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,080
development. The, I want to

681
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:08,360
clarify a point. Free market is not the

682
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:10,480
market. Let's say, it's like the sun that

683
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,840
illuminates everyone, rich and poor

684
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:16,519
alike. The market does the, does the

685
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,880
same. The market doesn't look at morality. The

686
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:22,360
market, simply, functions. But that

687
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:23,840
market functions according to the

688
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,279
amount of money in the system.

689
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:30,480
If money is very little, then the the

690
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,679
market takes care of ejecting everything, and and

691
00:31:32,679 --> 00:31:34,559
puts everything with the amount of money

692
00:31:34,559 --> 00:31:37,200
there is. If there's lots of money, it allows

693
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:40,120
many people to enter. The market doesn't look, doesn't

694
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:42,159
look at people. The market,

695
00:31:42,159 --> 00:31:44,200
simply, makes the

696
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:45,679
system function according to the amount of

697
00:31:45,679 --> 00:31:48,760
money there is. So, what this leads

698
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:51,039
us to is what Keynes told us, that

699
00:31:51,039 --> 00:31:53,480
what we have to control is the money

700
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,519
supply, money issuance, if

701
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:57,279
we want to control the system. No.

702
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,399
So, the market isn't good per se,

703
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,240
it's not bad per se. The market is something that

704
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:06,760
functions according to how you

705
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:09,600
feed it. Tariffs, I agree

706
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,360
on eliminating tariffs. Yes, very well.

707
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,480
We can eliminate tariffs. Interest

708
00:32:15,480 --> 00:32:18,200
rates, definitely, I

709
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:21,399
agree they should be very low, really,

710
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:23,840
lower than Keynes's. I think it can

711
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,320
happen. But what's very clear about

712
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:28,039
interest rates is that the deposit

713
00:32:28,039 --> 00:32:30,120
interest rate of the financial

714
00:32:30,120 --> 00:32:32,880
system should be eliminated, should be zero,

715
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:35,399
and we'll see why. We'll see it

716
00:32:35,399 --> 00:32:39,679
later. About fiscal deficit, I want to

717
00:32:39,679 --> 00:32:42,799
say that government can spend

718
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:44,440
everything

719
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,360
needed. Consumption, as we saw before,

720
00:32:48,360 --> 00:32:50,320
consumption of families and

721
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,159
government, government should fuel a

722
00:32:53,159 --> 00:32:55,559
consumption such that it's sufficient

723
00:32:55,559 --> 00:32:59,240
to also fuel the the market

724
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,440
and the capitalist

725
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:04,799
system can function. It's something like

726
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:06,880
saying the capitalist system has

727
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:08,960
to be composed of half socialist and

728
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,960
half capitalist. That socialist part,

729
00:33:11,960 --> 00:33:14,120
let's call it that, is what feeds

730
00:33:14,120 --> 00:33:16,399
resources to the system so

731
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:18,399
capitalists can work

732
00:33:18,399 --> 00:33:22,200
permanently. Fiscal deficit must

733
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:26,760
exist, and it can be as high as

734
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:28,919
required, high enough for the

735
00:33:28,919 --> 00:33:30,519
system to generate employment for

736
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,960
absolutely all people of working

737
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,200
age, for all people.

738
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:38,080
So, that, what does it mean? That

739
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,440
debt, or you'd believe that

740
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:42,279
debt should be very large. No,

741
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:45,799
look, debt can be zero,

742
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,159
as long as we make money

743
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,519
issuance, then, from the Central Bank

744
00:33:50,519 --> 00:33:51,960
directly to governments, without

745
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:54,600
need for loan or anything. The

746
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:58,360
money resource is unlimited. The problem is

747
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:01,760
how we can use it. Later

748
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:04,120
we'll explain all this. How, already in visual

749
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:07,600
form, by breaking down the the systems and

750
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,000
looking at how the economic system works,

751
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:13,480
then we'll see that

752
00:34:13,480 --> 00:34:16,480
point more clearly. Right now, I'm just

753
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:18,919
announcing it. Those money emissions

754
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:20,200
can be made

755
00:34:20,200 --> 00:34:24,280
freely, and zero debt. Taxes,

756
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:28,159
in this case, can be low,

757
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,560
quite low, just to make an

758
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:34,240
equitable redistribution of money

759
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:37,040
throughout the entire population. The

760
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:39,639
privatizations can be done, but

761
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:41,960
as long as there's competition in the

762
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,639
market, there's competition in supply. It's

763
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,280
more important that there's competition in

764
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,480
supply when dealing with, for example,

765
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:51,000
public

766
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:55,640
services. So, look, we have three

767
00:34:55,640 --> 00:34:57,680
possibilities. Not to mention there are more

768
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,040
possible combinations. It's that

769
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,240
when we talk about economic

770
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:04,280
policies of

771
00:35:04,280 --> 00:35:07,400
globalization, it means we can

772
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,800
combine, make many

773
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:12,800
combinations. The question would be: which of all the

774
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:16,000
policies is the best? And

775
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,119
it's very important to be able to solve that

776
00:35:18,119 --> 00:35:21,160
question. Will the International Monetary

777
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,520
Fund's be the best? We don't know.

778
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:27,720
That had to be proven. It had to

779
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,440
set the context and develop it, and

780
00:35:30,440 --> 00:35:32,079
we still don't

781
00:35:32,079 --> 00:35:35,040
know. The context we're going to propose

782
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:37,560
will allow us to define what's the

783
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:40,200
best policy of

784
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:45,040
all. This problem, what is the best

785
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:48,280
combination of these policies? So,

786
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:51,840
let's make, let's make a very

787
00:35:51,840 --> 00:35:55,040
important simulation to to be able to see the

788
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:58,760
general economic system, to separate

789
00:35:58,760 --> 00:36:02,040
the parts of that system, see how

790
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:05,319
each each part works and how it works

791
00:36:05,319 --> 00:36:09,440
as a whole. We're going to

792
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,480
arrive at this great economic system where

793
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,960
we're going to relate everything. Don't

794
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:19,839
be scared. Everything, when explained bit by

795
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:23,680
bit, comes out simpler. This

796
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,640
economic system we're going to integrate,

797
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:28,599
we're going to talk about a a country, a country

798
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:31,280
that has a Central Bank, a country

799
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,280
that develops a money supply, and money

800
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,240
supply that sometimes increases and sometimes

801
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:39,680
decreases. A country that has

802
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,119
exports and imports. A country

803
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:46,359
that receives credit, receives foreign

804
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:50,880
investment, sells assets, and receives income.

805
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,599
A country that manages international

806
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:55,960
reserves through an exchange

807
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,040
rate.

808
00:36:57,040 --> 00:37:00,000
A country that has a government that acts

809
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,920
and has income and budget

810
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:06,599
expenditures. A country where all

811
00:37:06,599 --> 00:37:10,079
economic activity develops in

812
00:37:10,079 --> 00:37:14,319
its three basic activities:

813
00:37:14,319 --> 00:37:18,480
agriculture, the the agro sector, the primary sector,

814
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:20,640
the secondary sector of industry, and the

815
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:23,000
tertiary sector of services,

816
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,760
including banking. A country where

817
00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,800
government does a type of works, where

818
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,560
government also intervenes in the in the

819
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,880
economy. A country where banking is

820
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,720
receiving some some resources that

821
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:42,319
we call deposits, where it

822
00:37:42,319 --> 00:37:45,000
interrelates with interest rates,

823
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:47,839
and lends to industry. Industry

824
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:50,720
and private individuals go into debt through

825
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:53,800
their costs and commercial activity,

826
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:58,240
where investment is generated and

827
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:02,119
the entire system interrelates. So,

828
00:38:02,119 --> 00:38:05,359
to be able to see that whole, we're going to

829
00:38:05,359 --> 00:38:07,760
develop it bit by bit. So, we're going to

830
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,359
develop this first part first

831
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:11,920
which is the one we

832
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:13,480
have

833
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:17,640
here. We have a country, any,

834
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:19,920
any, any country could be

835
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,160
the United States, could be Colombia, could

836
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:25,359
be China, could be Russia, could be

837
00:38:25,359 --> 00:38:27,599
whichever you want.

838
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,400
All countries function more or less

839
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:34,400
the same way. We have a Central

840
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:38,599
Bank in those countries. We have a

841
00:38:38,599 --> 00:38:41,480
government that's executing

842
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:44,160
income and budget

843
00:38:44,160 --> 00:38:46,960
income. We have a country that's

844
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:50,599
receiving money from many

845
00:38:50,599 --> 00:38:53,880
sources. We'll see them. Money that

846
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:58,119
sometimes increases, sometimes decreases.

847
00:38:58,240 --> 00:39:00,839
What's needed for the country to always

848
00:39:00,839 --> 00:39:03,839
be working perfectly well? That

849
00:39:03,839 -->

850
00:39:03,839 --> 00:39:05,840
money is always

851
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:08,319
increasing. It must be permanently

852
00:39:08,319 --> 00:39:09,760
increasing, because the country is

853
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,800
permanently

854
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,000
growing. For you to get

855
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,000
an idea of how serious it is not to have

856
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,800
money, then suddenly take

857
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:22,359
money from the system. Imagine it. This

858
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:24,760
you have to grasp in your imagination.

859
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,800
Take money from the system and think

860
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:28,880
what happens. If we take money from the

861
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:31,359
system, the system runs out

862
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:34,520
of money. Then, ah, you'll immediately

863
00:39:34,520 --> 00:39:37,599
say: no, well then we have to

864
00:39:37,599 --> 00:39:41,119
barter. No, barter worked

865
00:39:41,119 --> 00:39:44,440
when there were very few people, but

866
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:46,240
today, with this huge number of people, do you think

867
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:49,400
barter will work? Forget it. The

868
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:51,800
economy will stagnate, and the population

869
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:53,839
could starve to death if there's no

870
00:39:53,839 --> 00:39:56,440
money in the system.

871
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:57,880
No money, all

872
00:39:57,880 --> 00:40:00,359
trade stops, absolutely everything.

873
00:40:00,359 --> 00:40:03,480
Imagine it well. Then

874
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:05,560
you'll understand how important

875
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,400
money supply control is in the

876
00:40:07,400 --> 00:40:11,240
system. If the system oscillates, we'll

877
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,079
have, then, crises. If at a given

878
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:16,119
moment we have a good money supply, that's

879
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:18,280
growing, and money is cheap,

880
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:20,839
we'll have expansion. But if

881
00:40:20,839 --> 00:40:22,960
suddenly we stop it and raise the

882
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:24,599
interest rate, and start taking money

883
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:27,520
from the system, we'll have contraction.

884
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:29,640
When the Central Bank says: we have to

885
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,599
raise the interest rate, and we have to

886
00:40:32,599 --> 00:40:35,000
reduce public spending, then it's

887
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,599
saying to take money from the

888
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:38,560
system, and the system starts to

889
00:40:38,560 --> 00:40:41,280
contract, and the crisis starts to be seen.

890
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,960
So, what's the deal with

891
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:47,720
money? How does money emerge into the

892
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:50,119
economy and how does money leave the

893
00:40:50,119 --> 00:40:52,640
economy? We have to analyze that that

894
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,839
aspect. So, let's go step by step. When

895
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:58,760
people found gold, gold

896
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:01,560
prospectors found gold, and

897
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,280
came and sold it to the government, to the

898
00:41:03,280 --> 00:41:05,000
Central Bank, and the Central Bank

899
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,040
bought that gold, and pesos emerged into the

900
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,359
economy. Pesos emerged into the economy

901
00:41:10,359 --> 00:41:12,400
when we find gold. Pesos emerge into the

902
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,640
economy if they sell it directly

903
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,960
to the Central Bank. The Central Bank issues

904
00:41:17,960 --> 00:41:21,400
money, and pesos emerge into the economy.

905
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:23,400
Very important,

906
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:26,319
right? When we did that, we're

907
00:41:26,319 --> 00:41:28,560
stuck with, then, the

908
00:41:28,560 --> 00:41:31,920
backing for money was gold. I want to

909
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:34,640
tell you right away: money doesn't need

910
00:41:34,640 --> 00:41:36,960
backing for

911
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:39,680
anything. That was a historical stage, but

912
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:42,480
that was abandoned long ago. The

913
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,000
people, perhaps, still think

914
00:41:44,000 --> 00:41:46,280
backing is needed, but it's not true. It's

915
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:49,119
not needed. That emerged in that era, and

916
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:52,880
we're stuck with that gum there,

917
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,040
but we have to erase that, if

918
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:56,800
we want to keep evolu-

919
00:41:56,800 --> 00:42:01,359
ting. Money doesn't need backing of

920
00:42:01,359 --> 00:42:04,560
any kind. Well, another way money emerges

921
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,520
into the economy: when we make

922
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,040
exports.

923
00:42:08,040 --> 00:42:10,640
Our agents here make an

924
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,800
export, for example, we export coffee,

925
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:17,119
and from outside they pay us in dollars.

926
00:42:17,119 --> 00:42:19,240
Dollars that, when they enter here, stay

927
00:42:19,240 --> 00:42:21,359
in a box called reserves, which

928
00:42:21,359 --> 00:42:25,200
the Central Bank manages, and it issues pesos

929
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:26,680
to

930
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:29,000
to whoever made the export, and pesos

931
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,880
emerge for the domestic

932
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:35,000
economy. Those pesos increase when

933
00:42:35,000 --> 00:42:37,119
there are exports. But when there are

934
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,680
imports, then the agent who

935
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,520
made the import needs to pay in

936
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,440
dollars. So, they have to take pesos

937
00:42:46,440 --> 00:42:49,079
from here, from circulation, come here and

938
00:42:49,079 --> 00:42:50,640
buy

939
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:53,599
dollars, and the pesos, notice, that come and

940
00:42:53,599 --> 00:42:55,280
return to the Central Bank, and

941
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,280
disappear from from

942
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:00,400
circulation. And then, this agent,

943
00:43:00,400 --> 00:43:03,280
with dollars, pays that

944
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:07,160
import. Well, exports increase

945
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:11,760
money, imports decrease

946
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:14,520
money.

947
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:18,079
When credit comes from

948
00:43:18,079 --> 00:43:20,559
abroad, a company here requests a

949
00:43:20,559 --> 00:43:22,400
loan, a company could be the same

950
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,280
government requesting a loan, could

951
00:43:24,280 --> 00:43:25,760
be a private company requesting a

952
00:43:25,760 --> 00:43:27,559
loan.

953
00:43:27,559 --> 00:43:30,640
When that happens, then

954
00:43:30,640 --> 00:43:33,480
credit comes, the bank's reserves

955
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:35,640
increase, and the bank issues pesos. Pesos

956
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:37,440
emerge into the

957
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:40,720
economy. When a foreign agent

958
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:42,800
comes to make an investment, when an

959
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:45,400
oil company comes to invest, it brings

960
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:51,119
dollars, and pesos are issued, and

961
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:53,559
reserves increase.

962
00:43:53,559 --> 00:43:57,000
Well, that's how pesos emerge into the

963
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,920
economy. What happens later when the

964
00:44:00,920 --> 00:44:04,359
credit has to be repaid? Then, people, the

965
00:44:04,359 --> 00:44:08,000
people here have to take pesos from here,

966
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,480
and pay. They bring pesos, buy dollars, and pay

967
00:44:13,480 --> 00:44:16,400
in dollars. What happened to the pesos? They

968
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:19,760
came to the Central Bank, pesos left

969
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:22,400
the economy's circulation. The

970
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,359
pesos, when they enter the Central Bank,

971
00:44:24,359 --> 00:44:26,319
disappear from the economy's

972
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:28,920
circulation, and we need the

973
00:44:28,920 --> 00:44:32,079
pesos to be here circulating. So, there

974
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,280
we see that sometimes it increases, and sometimes

975
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:37,760
it decreases. When investment also

976
00:44:37,760 --> 00:44:41,079
starts reverting profits, then

977
00:44:41,079 --> 00:44:43,800
the reverse process: pesos come to

978
00:44:43,800 --> 00:44:46,960
the Central Bank, and are paid in dollars.

979
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,920
When we sell, what happens when we sell

980
00:44:48,920 --> 00:44:50,839
an asset or a company? When we sold,

981
00:44:50,839 --> 00:44:54,240
uh, the energy company, the energy

982
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:57,200
company was sold, dollars entered,

983
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:59,200
but then, they start taking

984
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:00,880
out

985
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:03,319
profits. So, what, what happens?

986
00:45:03,319 --> 00:45:06,280
We take pesos from here, buy dollars,

987
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,960
and are paid in dollars. So, pesos start

988
00:45:08,960 --> 00:45:12,480
leaving. Very well. Here we could

989
00:45:12,480 --> 00:45:15,119
ask ourselves a question: if no more

990
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,839
elements existed, but only these,

991
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:21,839
imports, exports, which is what

992
00:45:21,839 --> 00:45:26,720
we call the the the

993
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:31,079
the trade balance, or the balance of

994
00:45:31,079 --> 00:45:34,720
payments, when we combine both with

995
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,319
with internal gold resources, we can

996
00:45:37,319 --> 00:45:40,960
ask ourselves: if no more elements exist,

997
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:44,160
what could be happening here with

998
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:47,000
pesos? With the entry and exit of

999
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:50,960
pesos. So, what will be greater? The

1000
00:45:50,960 --> 00:45:55,000
exports or the imports?

1001
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,240
These two, I want to tell you, in general,

1002
00:45:58,240 --> 00:46:01,559
tend to balance. They tend to be

1003
00:46:01,559 --> 00:46:05,240
equal. If nothing else existed, these

1004
00:46:05,240 --> 00:46:08,160
two should be equal, and then the

1005
00:46:08,160 --> 00:46:10,720
dollar price, according to the

1006
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,520
amount of reserves there are, the price

1007
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,960
can rise or fall, and it rises and falls in such a

1008
00:46:15,960 --> 00:46:18,960
way that it balances these

1009
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,920
two. Let's say, a tie there. But this can

1010
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,760
become unbalanced at some given

1011
00:46:23,760 --> 00:46:26,760
moment. We'll see later.

1012
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,200
What happens with credit? What will be greater,

1013
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:33,200
income or outflow? So, now

1014
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:35,480
putting this to work over time,

1015
00:46:35,480 --> 00:46:37,160
a 10-year loan, so, at

1016
00:46:37,160 --> 00:46:39,119
the beginning, no, the loan came in, very well,

1017
00:46:39,119 --> 00:46:41,480
good money came in, but later you have to

1018
00:46:41,480 --> 00:46:44,599
you have to pay it back in the term of 10 years.

1019
00:46:44,599 --> 00:46:48,000
What will be better, the greater, income or

1020
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:52,800
outflow of money? So, you, of course,

1021
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:54,680
you have to pay not only the loan, the

1022
00:46:54,680 --> 00:46:56,680
loan amount,

1023
00:46:56,680 --> 00:46:58,720
the loan, but also the interest.

1024
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,240
So, will the outflows

1025
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,960
of money be greater, right? When long-term

1026
00:47:04,960 --> 00:47:07,760
investment comes, what will be greater,

1027
00:47:07,760 --> 00:47:09,440
entry or

1028
00:47:09,440 --> 00:47:13,559
exit? Exit. When there's asset

1029
00:47:13,559 --> 00:47:15,760
sales, what will be greater, entry or

1030
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:18,960
exit? So, everyone will agree that

1031
00:47:18,960 --> 00:47:21,000
money outflow, so, if no

1032
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:24,200
more elements exist, you'll

1033
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,480
realize why a crisis arrives, because

1034
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,359
outflows will be greater. Money

1035
00:47:29,359 --> 00:47:33,079
outflows. You'll say: but,

1036
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:34,680
but, but, isn't that what's happening

1037
00:47:34,680 --> 00:47:36,000
right now.

1038
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,559
Right now all that is happening, but

1039
00:47:38,559 --> 00:47:41,040
many dollars are arriving. Yes, but

1040
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:42,680
we're still going into debt,

1041
00:47:42,680 --> 00:47:45,880
into debt, into debt, and then those

1042
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:48,200
greater debts make reserves

1043
00:47:48,200 --> 00:47:49,720
increase. You, have you noticed

1044
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:51,880
we have very high reserves,

1045
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:54,920
almost in the order of 25,000 million

1046
00:47:54,920 --> 00:47:56,559
of of of

1047
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,359
dollars, a

1048
00:47:58,359 --> 00:48:03,559
huge amount. And that makes the dollar

1049
00:48:03,559 --> 00:48:06,520
low. We're still going into debt, in

1050
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,400
the debt process.

1051
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,200
So, when all that has to be paid,

1052
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:14,559
the whole mess will unravel, and the

1053
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:16,800
crisis will be terrible. In fact, we

1054
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:21,000
already have a crisis right now. What happens,

1055
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:24,280
then, if there are no more elements but

1056
00:48:24,280 --> 00:48:26,760
those? So, realize, that first we

1057
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,920
go into debt. When we go into debt,

1058
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:31,200
reserves increase. Notice that the

1059
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:33,800
dollar price is very special. When

1060
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:36,760
there are many dollars, its price drops. When

1061
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:38,960
the price drops, then

1062
00:48:38,960 --> 00:48:41,280
imports, since they get

1063
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:44,280
cheaper, will increase. We unbalance

1064
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,720
the trade balance, right? So, when

1065
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,359
we unbalance that balance,

1066
00:48:49,359 --> 00:48:52,359
then, internally, very

1067
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:55,760
cheap products enter, and our industry has

1068
00:48:55,760 --> 00:48:59,480
difficulty. It's going to, it's going to start closing,

1069
00:48:59,480 --> 00:49:01,079
it's going to start failing. It can't handle

1070
00:49:01,079 --> 00:49:03,480
that competition. How did

1071
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,079
this become unbalanced? With credit, with many dollars.

1072
00:49:07,079 --> 00:49:09,760
Many dollars, low price, and then

1073
00:49:09,760 --> 00:49:12,200
this trade balance became unbalanced. In

1074
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,880
fact, since we started, more or less

1075
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:17,760
in '91, that before imports and

1076
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,200
exports oscillated, they stopped

1077
00:49:20,200 --> 00:49:22,720
oscillating, and imports are always

1078
00:49:22,720 --> 00:49:25,720
greater, since, since back then,

1079
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:28,839
since '91, when that

1080
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:31,799
globalization began in Colombia, when that

1081
00:49:31,799 --> 00:49:34,240
globalization of not issuing money

1082
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,920
began in Colombia. So, notice how we can also

1083
00:49:36,920 --> 00:49:40,440
feed this system. The Central Bank

1084
00:49:40,440 --> 00:49:43,040
makes a money issuance, and gives it to the

1085
00:49:43,040 --> 00:49:45,839
government so the government includes it

1086
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:48,839
within its income, and within its

1087
00:49:48,839 --> 00:49:51,079
expenses. Government expenses are

1088
00:49:51,079 --> 00:49:53,040
operating

1089
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:55,760
expenses, investment expenses, and

1090
00:49:55,760 --> 00:49:58,359
debt

1091
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:04,640
service. Government income is

1092
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:06,760
current income and capital

1093
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:09,000
resources. Well, that money being made

1094
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,760
can come as a capital resource.

1095
00:50:11,760 --> 00:50:13,960
Normally, that capital resource is what

1096
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,760
enters as a debt, a debt from the

1097
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:19,040
Central Bank, or a debt from other

1098
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:21,240
banks. The government goes into debt with other

1099
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:24,160
banks. So, it's a capital resource.

1100
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:26,319
This capital resource can be a

1101
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,680
very special thing, because it wouldn't have to

1102
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:30,480
be

1103
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,920
a loan, but a resource from

1104
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,520
itself, because the Central Bank and

1105
00:50:36,520 --> 00:50:39,799
government are the same, and money is

1106
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:42,119
money that's socially needed. So,

1107
00:50:42,119 --> 00:50:44,599
then, money can enter

1108
00:50:44,599 --> 00:50:48,040
government not as a loan, but as the

1109
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,640
the part, the contribution needed for

1110
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,960
that year. Notice that makes

1111
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:56,280
debt disappear. So, yes, a

1112
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:59,680
country can function without debt, with this

1113
00:50:59,680 --> 00:51:03,160
issuance resource, to balance those

1114
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,599
money inflows and outflows, to

1115
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:08,400
balance so money grows

1116
00:51:08,400 --> 00:51:09,680
permanently.

1117
00:51:09,680 --> 00:51:12,440
In what amounts? In the amounts

1118
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,920
needed for employment to be generated

1119
00:51:14,920 --> 00:51:17,760
for the entire population, not until

1120
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:21,520
prices overflow. No, what's needed. The

1122
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:26,000
thing is that this resource is unlimited.

1123
00:51:26,000 --> 00:51:28,079
The fundamental thing is the universe is

1124
00:51:28,079 --> 00:51:30,040
unlimited. The universe can give us

1125
00:51:30,040 --> 00:51:32,720
absolutely everything we want, and

1126
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:35,480
here, money is also unlimited.

1127
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,119
We've always fought that we don't

1128
00:51:37,119 --> 00:51:39,079
have money, that money is

1129
00:51:39,079 --> 00:51:42,240
held by the Americans and Europeans. They

1130
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:44,839
do it the same way. They do it from

1131
00:51:44,839 --> 00:51:47,799
here, so, and they do it with, that's why I

1132
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:49,720
was saying this can be any country

1133
00:51:49,720 --> 00:51:54,400
in in the world. Well, that money would enter, and

1134
00:51:54,400 --> 00:51:56,720
notice, would enter balancing a

1135
00:51:56,720 --> 00:52:00,240
need. Would it produce

1136
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,680
inflation

1137
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:04,960
necessarily? We're giving the money

1138
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:07,119
needed for all

1139
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:09,319
production to keep growing permanently.

1140
00:52:09,319 --> 00:52:12,200
So, no, it's not necessarily

1141
00:52:12,200 --> 00:52:14,520
inflationary. In fact, it's not

1142
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:17,520
inflationary. What's more, once there's

1143
00:52:17,520 --> 00:52:19,839
good money circulating in the system,

1144
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:21,520
a moment came when

1145
00:52:21,520 --> 00:52:23,160
producers have so much

1146
00:52:23,160 --> 00:52:25,799
competition arise, that prices have to

1147
00:52:25,799 --> 00:52:29,280
fall, and would tend to fall, if at the beginning

1148
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,119
there is inflation. Well, what's

1149
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,240
important is that money enters for

1150
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,640
government, and government, as it would

1151
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:41,960
deposit it in a bank, then a

1152
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:44,520
multiplier factor enters on the banking

1153
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:48,160
side, which would make, when government

1154
00:52:48,160 --> 00:52:50,720
is going to buy from a

1155
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:52,960
private party, that private party can

1156
00:52:52,960 --> 00:52:54,319
find resources also to

1157
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:57,480
go into debt with banking, and be able to respond,

1158
00:52:57,480 --> 00:53:00,079
and production can emerge, in balance, with

1159
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:04,559
demand. So, no, no,

1160
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:07,319
there's no reason for that inflation to be generated. Let's make

1161
00:53:07,319 --> 00:53:09,799
a simulation, a very

1162
00:53:09,799 --> 00:53:14,040
special simulation. Let's make a bridge, a

1163
00:53:14,040 --> 00:53:17,559
bridge with issuance, and let's make a bridge

1164
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:21,520
with debt, and we're going to see how

1165
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:26,160
things work. Let's first make the bridge

1166
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:29,640
with debt, sorry, with issuance.

1167
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:33,480
So, what happens? Government, the Central

1168
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:35,400
Bank makes a money issuance, delivers it

1169
00:53:35,400 --> 00:53:37,240
to government, which puts it within

1170
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:39,599
its income, and through spending,

1171
00:53:39,599 --> 00:53:42,480
as investment spending, makes the bridge.

1172
00:53:42,480 --> 00:53:46,040
So, what happened? It stayed, the money

1173
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:47,880
supply increased, money stayed

1174
00:53:47,880 --> 00:53:51,040
circulating among everyone, among the entire

1175
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:56,480
country, the bridge was made, and the money stayed

1176
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,960
circulating. It won't return, because it

1177
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:01,280
doesn't have to return. It stayed circulating

1178
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:06,440
there, and so it remains permanently

1179
00:54:06,440 --> 00:54:09,400
functioning. Let's now make that same

1180
00:54:09,400 --> 00:54:13,000
bridge with with debt. So, what's the

1181
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:15,280
system to do that? Credit comes

1182
00:54:15,280 --> 00:54:19,400
from abroad, credit that leaves

1183
00:54:19,400 --> 00:54:21,599
reserves, and they're monetized. So, the

1184
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,280
Central Bank issues money, too,

1185
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,920
but then

1186
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:28,280
a part stayed here, in

1187
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,599
reserves. Money was issued, the bridge

1188
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,799
was made, the same way, but we're left

1189
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:38,359
owing a bridge and some

1190
00:54:38,359 --> 00:54:42,480
interest. I don't know if you can realize

1191
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,200
how unfair it is to be left owing

1192
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,000
a bridge with interest, when this

1193
00:54:47,000 --> 00:54:48,680
way we made the bridge, and money was left

1194
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:51,839
circulating, and we're not left owing

1195
00:54:51,839 --> 00:54:54,440
anyone. We made the bridge, and we're left

1196
00:54:54,440 --> 00:54:56,440
owing

1197
00:54:56,440 --> 00:54:59,400
everything. This, both the bridge and the

1198
00:54:59,400 --> 00:55:02,680
interest. That is, that these

1199
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:04,599
developing countries that resorted to

1200
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:06,839
credit, end up paying the pensioners

1201
00:55:06,839 --> 00:55:10,359
of the countries that made the loan.

1202
00:55:10,359 --> 00:55:13,920
That, that's what happens with

1203
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:17,040
going into debt with international banking.

1204
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:21,440
That's debt. Debt, and it enslaves,

1205
00:55:21,440 --> 00:55:23,760
enslaves nations. What I'm

1206
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:26,480
talking about here is there's no need to

1207
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:28,720
be enslaved. All countries

1208
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,160
can do this mechanism, and all

1209
00:55:31,160 --> 00:55:32,280
countries

1210
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,240
can eliminate debt, stop being a

1211
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,280
debt country, a country enslaved by

1212
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:41,760
debt. It means all countries

1213
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,880
have the capacity to win their own

1214
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:46,440
freedom, and have the

1215
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:49,520
necessary resources to

1216
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:52,880
have what's needed for their subsistence

1217
00:55:52,880 --> 00:55:56,200
and spend their life on this, on this

1218
00:55:56,200 --> 00:55:59,240
planet. But the story of

1219
00:55:59,240 --> 00:56:02,160
of the bridge with debt doesn't end there, because

1220
00:56:02,160 --> 00:56:04,520
it turns out those reserves, means

1221
00:56:04,520 --> 00:56:08,119
imports increased. You

1222
00:56:08,119 --> 00:56:10,760
remember, greater amount of reserves,

1223
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,200
lower foreign prices, and then

1224
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:17,160
these people take their income to

1225
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:18,839
buy cheaper abroad, and they

1226
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:20,920
go back and recover the

1227
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:23,319
money. Their dollars go back and they

1228
00:56:23,319 --> 00:56:26,119
recover them, and we do destroy

1229
00:56:26,119 --> 00:56:30,319
our own industries, in favor of

1230
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:33,640
of foreigners. So, the

1231
00:56:33,640 --> 00:56:37,400
panorama of of debt is complete. The country that

1232
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:40,119
goes into debt with another, immediately passed

1233
00:56:40,119 --> 00:56:42,280
to being enslaved, buying all

1234
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:44,599
products, unbalancing its own

1235
00:56:44,599 --> 00:56:45,799
trade

1236
00:56:45,799 --> 00:56:48,880
balance, and entering a very

1237
00:56:48,880 --> 00:56:52,359
complicated situation. What happens when

1238
00:56:52,359 --> 00:56:55,799
issuance isn't made? When we deny issuance,

1239
00:56:55,799 --> 00:56:57,359
like we did right now, that

1240
00:56:57,359 --> 00:56:59,960
we said in the Constitution of '91, and in

1241
00:56:59,960 --> 00:57:01,520
general, in all countries, at their

1242
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,799
moment, they prohibited Central Bank

1243
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:06,599
credits to government. Central Bank

1244
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:07,960
credit to government cannot be made. These

1245
00:57:07,960 --> 00:57:09,319
issuances we're talking about cannot be made. So,

1246
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:11,400
what happens? Well, we already saw it, we already know

1247
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:15,039
that, then, the country runs out

1248
00:57:15,039 --> 00:57:18,240
of money. How does

1249
00:57:18,240 --> 00:57:21,960
the president of that country act then? What

1250
00:57:21,960 --> 00:57:25,280
does he have to do? Since, since he knows he doesn't

1251
00:57:25,280 --> 00:57:27,319
have money, and needs money,

1252
00:57:27,319 --> 00:57:30,000
forcibly, then, he has to resort to

1253
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,440
a

1254
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,200
loan. A loan to increase this

1255
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,400
money supply, right? The loan comes,

1256
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:39,640
the money supply increases, and vi, then,

1257
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:41,240
and it has to be paid later, with

1258
00:57:41,240 --> 00:57:43,760
interest. When the moment comes to

1259
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,160
pay the debt,

1260
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,799
would be left with that hole, the money

1261
00:57:49,799 --> 00:57:52,280
supply would decrease. So, to be able to pay

1262
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,920
that, he has to get credit

1263
00:57:54,920 --> 00:57:56,920
exactly

1264
00:57:56,920 --> 00:58:00,839
equal, plus a larger

1265
00:58:00,839 --> 00:58:05,440
credit, plus interest, that later, to

1266
00:58:05,440 --> 00:58:08,039
be able to pay this, then, he has to

1267
00:58:08,039 --> 00:58:10,599
get credit to be able to pay. That

1268
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:13,640
is, he ends up always renegotiating

1269
00:58:13,640 --> 00:58:17,200
debt. That is, he ends up always giving away

1270
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:18,319
the

1271
00:58:18,319 --> 00:58:21,000
interest, permanently renegotiating

1272
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:23,760
debt. That is, debt that

1273
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,119
will permanently keep increasing. That's

1274
00:58:26,119 --> 00:58:28,520
why, all countries that started the

1275
00:58:28,520 --> 00:58:31,240
globalization tale and not issuing,

1276
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,160
the first thing that's grown on them

1277
00:58:33,160 --> 00:58:35,960
impressively is debt, and

1278
00:58:35,960 --> 00:58:38,319
debt has tied them, then, to the

1279
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,240
will of of banks, and what

1280
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:42,359
bankers

1281
00:58:42,359 --> 00:58:44,799
define. Because, besides, we

1282
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:46,720
made central banks independent, and

1283
00:58:46,720 --> 00:58:50,119
put bankers there, who only

1284
00:58:50,119 --> 00:58:53,359
defend the interests of banking, of

1285
00:58:53,359 --> 00:58:55,920
banking, of private banking. So,

1286
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:59,280
countries, what did they end up in? In an

1287
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:01,240
increase of debt. And that's something

1288
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:04,000
explosive, for this reason. When we don't

1289
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,200
issue, you can say it's

1290
00:59:06,200 --> 00:59:08,839
a matter of time. The catastrophe will

1291
00:59:08,839 --> 00:59:12,200
come. It's inevitable, and we're

1292
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,000
seeing it, because the United States is also

1293
00:59:14,000 --> 00:59:16,720
complying with

1294
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:20,720
this. Despite that at this moment, in

1295
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:22,280
the United States they're processing a

1296
00:59:22,280 --> 00:59:24,880
credit of 700,000 million

1297
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,280
dollars. If they don't keep doing it

1298
00:59:27,280 --> 00:59:29,440
permanently, then they'll have

1299
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:31,880
this situation. Sooner or later, they give

1300
00:59:31,880 --> 00:59:34,160
it a respite, but later they'll

1301
00:59:34,160 --> 00:59:36,440
have the same situation again. Same as all

1302
00:59:36,440 --> 00:59:39,079
Europe, same as everything, the whole world.

1303
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:42,119
So, that's what happens when we don't

1304
00:59:42,119 --> 00:59:44,319
issue. When we don't issue,

1305
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:47,680
we're left enslaved. To be able to pay this,

1306
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,920
imagine what we'd have to do.

1307
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,799
An army of ours go and make them

1308
00:59:51,799 --> 00:59:53,319
the same bridge, there in the United States, on

1309
00:59:53,319 --> 00:59:57,280
our behalf, and make the bridge, and bring

1310
00:59:57,280 --> 00:59:59,240
on our behalf our people, and

1311
00:59:59,240 --> 01:00:02,240
be able to settle the situation? When, look,

1312
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:04,359
with money issuance alone, we can

1313
01:00:04,359 --> 01:00:06,359
make our bridge, and our economy

1314
01:00:06,359 --> 01:00:08,039
remains

1315
01:00:08,039 --> 01:00:10,599
sound. This tells us that no

1316
01:00:10,599 --> 01:00:13,559
country should have debt. No country

1317
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:16,680
has a reason to enslave another, and all

1318
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,440
could

1319
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:21,640
live well enough from their own

1320
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:23,680
work. No country has a reason to go

1321
01:00:23,680 --> 01:00:24,720
exploit

1322
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:27,640
another. When we talk about exploitation

1323
01:00:27,640 --> 01:00:30,280
of one country by another, it's because we think

1324
01:00:30,280 --> 01:00:33,000
that resources are limited, and that this

1325
01:00:33,000 --> 01:00:36,200
we can't do. Well, and there's another

1326
01:00:36,200 --> 01:00:40,319
element we have more, more ahead.

1327
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,200
Well, let's see, let's go to the second part

1328
01:00:44,200 --> 01:00:48,000
of of the

1329
01:00:48,039 --> 01:00:50,680
problem. How does this interest rate thing

1330
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,480
work? We have a Central

1331
01:00:52,480 --> 01:00:54,520
Bank,

1332
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:57,280
any bank, a bank that collects

1333
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:00,440
resources from the public, and in exchange for those

1334
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,400
public resources, pays an interest

1335
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:04,720
rate we call deposit

1336
01:01:04,720 --> 01:01:08,960
interest. It pays to the, we've called

1337
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:12,000
this term very badly, to the savers.

1338
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,039
No, these aren't savers. Savings is

1339
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:17,559
a very different concept in economics. We

1340
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:21,319
already saw before. It's not the money that, that

1341
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:23,799
banks pay. That's deposit

1342
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:24,559
interest.

1343
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:27,559
Banks take is those

1344
01:01:27,559 --> 01:01:30,640
resources they collected from the public, and

1345
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:33,720
lend them to companies. At what rate do

1346
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:36,599
they lend them? Well, at an interest rate

1347
01:01:36,599 --> 01:01:39,119
that includes this deposit rate, obviously,

1348
01:01:39,119 --> 01:01:42,640
they repeat it, plus an intermediation

1349
01:01:42,640 --> 01:01:45,680
rate. So, these rates are

1350
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:50,160
being transmitted from bank to

1351
01:01:50,160 --> 01:01:53,400
company. And, what does the company,

1352
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:56,319
then, do with those expenses it has

1353
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,920
there? It's paying interest. Where

1354
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,039
is it charging this? Well, all that it's

1355
01:02:02,039 --> 01:02:04,760
going to send to the product

1356
01:02:04,760 --> 01:02:07,119
price, and then the product

1357
01:02:07,119 --> 01:02:10,760
price returns it to the the general

1358
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,680
public, it includes again what it

1359
01:02:14,680 --> 01:02:15,920
is

1360
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,240
being paid in those interest payments. That is,

1361
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:23,240
it's generating inflation. That de-, that

1362
01:02:23,240 --> 01:02:26,039
deposit rate, is generating

1363
01:02:26,039 --> 01:02:29,319
inflation. Notice that inflation, I'm

1364
01:02:29,319 --> 01:02:31,799
telling you here, isn't produced by

1365
01:02:31,799 --> 01:02:37,520
money issuance. It's produced by that interest

1366
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,079
rate.

1367
01:02:41,079 --> 01:02:45,160
Well, the company returns it, and charges.

1368
01:02:45,160 --> 01:02:48,119
But, what does the interest rate do? The interest

1369
01:02:48,119 --> 01:02:50,760
rate is as if it decreased the

1370
01:02:50,760 --> 01:02:53,880
money supply. So, it'll generate a

1371
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,839
crisis. It'll generate a crisis, it's going

1372
01:02:56,839 --> 01:02:59,799
to generate that the, the

1373
01:02:59,799 --> 01:03:02,160
business owners have that as competition,

1374
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,359
that deposit interest rate, and can't

1375
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:06,520
generate all the sales they

1376
01:03:06,520 --> 01:03:08,799
require. There are many expenses that that go

1377
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:11,640
to this point. So, the

1378
01:03:11,640 --> 01:03:13,520
companies won't employ all the

1379
01:03:13,520 --> 01:03:15,319
people they could employ, if that

1380
01:03:15,319 --> 01:03:16,839
rate

1381
01:03:16,839 --> 01:03:20,200
didn't exist. In fact, it cut the money supply.

1382
01:03:20,200 --> 01:03:21,760
So, that makes there be fewer

1383
01:03:21,760 --> 01:03:24,240
companies. So, that deposit interest

1384
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:27,440
rate not only is

1385
01:03:27,440 --> 01:03:30,599
recessionary, but, well, it's going to

1386
01:03:30,599 --> 01:03:33,480
necessarily generate a residual margin of

1387
01:03:33,480 --> 01:03:36,520
unemployment that can't, that can't. There's a

1388
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,000
very large margin that will never

1389
01:03:38,000 --> 01:03:41,599
be employed. Well, that's the phenomenon of

1390
01:03:41,599 --> 01:03:44,599
the deposit interest rate. What

1391
01:03:44,599 --> 01:03:47,599
to do?

1392
01:03:47,680 --> 01:03:49,480
Eliminate it.

1393
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,839
Ah, but then, who's going to

1394
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,480
put their money in the bank if they're not paid

1395
01:03:54,480 --> 01:03:56,839
anything? Everyone will keep taking

1396
01:03:56,839 --> 01:03:59,359
their money to the bank, because no one's going to

1397
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:01,480
walk around with 50 million pesos in their

1398
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:04,480
pocket, putting themselves here, for it to be

1399
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,279
stolen. No, people will keep taking

1400
01:04:07,279 --> 01:04:09,960
their money to the bank. What's going to happen is

1401
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:13,279
that, if people have a lot of money in the

1402
01:04:13,279 --> 01:04:16,559
bank, they'll is move it. They'll set up an

1403
01:04:16,559 --> 01:04:18,640
industry, they'll buy land, and they're going to

1404
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:20,599
make a building to rent

1405
01:04:20,599 --> 01:04:24,640
apartments, and they'll earn their

1406
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:26,279
wages

1407
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:29,760
by working, their salary by working, and not

1408
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,359
like a drone, waiting for the bank

1409
01:04:32,359 --> 01:04:36,359
to pay them interest. I want to say that

1410
01:04:36,359 --> 01:04:38,359
those who, generally, have money, have been

1411
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:40,760
industrialists, people who know how to work. They

1412
01:04:40,760 --> 01:04:42,839
don't care about this rate.

1413
01:04:42,839 --> 01:04:44,839
They'd earn more outside. What

1414
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:47,960
happens is that this rate competes with

1415
01:04:47,960 --> 01:04:50,799
industry, whereas industry

1416
01:04:50,799 --> 01:04:53,319
has to

1417
01:04:53,319 --> 01:04:57,119
employ many people, with deal with

1418
01:04:57,119 --> 01:04:59,760
suppliers, with employees, with machinery,

1419
01:04:59,760 --> 01:05:03,319
with everything, to earn a profit. The

1420
01:05:03,319 --> 01:05:04,760
bank,

1421
01:05:04,760 --> 01:05:08,000
simply, offers that same

1422
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,880
profit, without doing absolutely anything.

1423
01:05:10,880 --> 01:05:13,640
So, there's a limit, that if you

1424
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:15,760
have, for example, 100 million pesos,

1425
01:05:15,760 --> 01:05:18,640
and doing all this, you'll get a

1426
01:05:18,640 --> 01:05:20,839
profit of 8%, well, you put the money

1427
01:05:20,839 --> 01:05:23,960
in the bank, because the bank gives 8%.

1428
01:05:23,960 --> 01:05:27,039
So, you stopped making an industry,

1429
01:05:27,039 --> 01:05:29,240
because this put a lower limit on

1430
01:05:29,240 --> 01:05:30,319
the

1431
01:05:30,319 --> 01:05:33,400
industries. That deposit interest is

1432
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:35,400
competing, making industries

1433
01:05:35,400 --> 01:05:38,839
not develop as far as they should

1434
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:43,680
go, generating that, that unemployment.

1435
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:48,720
Well, if the scheme is clear, very simple,

1436
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:50,440
besides.

1437
01:05:50,440 --> 01:05:54,559
We can see that, when the Central Bank

1438
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:57,359
and all analysts tell us we have to

1439
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:59,279
raise the interest rate to

1440
01:05:59,279 --> 01:06:01,839
control inflation, it's false. The

1441
01:06:01,839 --> 01:06:04,880
inflation will be generated by that interest

1442
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:07,920
rate. Why did we come to believe that that

1443
01:06:07,920 --> 01:06:11,880
interest would reduce inflation?

1444
01:06:11,880 --> 01:06:14,760
Because theory tells us that, when that

1445
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:17,480
interest rate is raised, the money

1446
01:06:17,480 --> 01:06:21,160
supply is reduced, company

1447
01:06:21,160 --> 01:06:24,119
sales are reduced, and when

1448
01:06:24,119 --> 01:06:27,359
demand drops, then, prices will drop.

1449
01:06:27,359 --> 01:06:30,279
But no, it's not true. Prices won't

1450
01:06:30,279 --> 01:06:32,200
drop, because production also drops,

1451
01:06:32,200 --> 01:06:35,679
and they're left, both are reduced,

1452
01:06:35,679 --> 01:06:38,680
supply and demand, and prices

1453
01:06:38,680 --> 01:06:42,440
continue. Why? Those interest

1454
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,200
payments that are there go

1455
01:06:44,200 --> 01:06:47,240
to the product price. So, there's no

1456
01:06:47,240 --> 01:06:49,680
such thing. The government tells

1457
01:06:49,680 --> 01:06:52,920
us, analysts, today today,

1458
01:06:52,920 --> 01:06:55,760
tell us three elements: that we have to

1459
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:58,760
raise the interest rate, that we have to

1460
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:00,760
reduce public spending, and that

1461
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:02,240
issuances

1462
01:07:02,240 --> 01:07:05,599
can't be made. So, now, let's put all

1463
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,599
the discourse together. Let's put all the

1464
01:07:08,599 --> 01:07:11,440
discourse back together, and then, how does that

1465
01:07:11,440 --> 01:07:15,119
first part combine with the interest

1466
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:18,920
part? We already know, then, what happens

1467
01:07:18,920 --> 01:07:21,000
when we raise the interest rate,

1468
01:07:21,000 --> 01:07:23,480
as all analysts tell us.

1469
01:07:23,480 --> 01:07:25,760
We also already know what happens when

1470
01:07:25,760 --> 01:07:28,480
we reduce the the public spending. When

1471
01:07:28,480 --> 01:07:30,319
we reduce public spending, it

1472
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,400
means we don't make issuances. So,

1473
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,680
we're going to run out of money.

1474
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,240
So, the economy will contract. It

1475
01:07:38,240 --> 01:07:41,319
contracts when we reduce public

1476
01:07:41,319 --> 01:07:44,440
spending. The economy contracts. As

1477
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,279
all analysts tell us, what

1478
01:07:46,279 --> 01:07:47,960
we have to do to solve the

1479
01:07:47,960 --> 01:07:50,440
crisis: raise the interest rate and

1480
01:07:50,440 --> 01:07:53,599
reduce public spending. Well, there we

1481
01:07:53,599 --> 01:07:54,920
realize what they're

1482
01:07:54,920 --> 01:07:56,559
asking us is to go into a

1483
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:00,839
crisis. That is, what all

1484
01:08:00,839 --> 01:08:02,799
analysts are telling us right now is wrong, that

1485
01:08:02,799 --> 01:08:04,720
the remedy is to raise the rate and

1486
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,720
reduce public spending. Well, let's put,

1487
01:08:07,720 --> 01:08:09,520
then, the discourse together. So, how can

1488
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:13,600
society work for us? Well, we already

1489
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,839
know, then, that if we make money

1490
01:08:16,839 --> 01:08:20,400
issuance, we don't have to go into debt.

1491
01:08:20,400 --> 01:08:23,440
By not having to go into debt,

1492
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,759
then, imports and

1493
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:28,120
exports will balance. At

1494
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:30,120
the beginning, at the beginning, there'll be the

1495
01:08:30,120 --> 01:08:33,359
adjustment. And it's that returning

1496
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,680
starts, well, what we're already owing, which

1497
01:08:35,680 --> 01:08:37,839
should, rather, be cancelled, because that

1498
01:08:37,839 --> 01:08:40,640
was theft. But, well, let's say we

1499
01:08:40,640 --> 01:08:44,279
can make the adjustment, returning to

1500
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:47,079
to everyone what we once

1501
01:08:47,079 --> 01:08:49,560
negotiated. Anyway, we already know

1502
01:08:49,560 --> 01:08:53,359
how we can get out of the problem.

1503
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,960
The

1504
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:57,320
reserves, the exchange rate, has a

1505
01:08:57,320 --> 01:09:01,159
high equilibrium point, or low.

1506
01:09:01,159 --> 01:09:03,960
We hope to reach

1507
01:09:03,960 --> 01:09:06,600
equilibrium. When the exchange

1508
01:09:06,600 --> 01:09:09,560
rate is low, imports grow. When

1509
01:09:09,560 --> 01:09:12,440
we make issuances, we don't go further into debt.

1510
01:09:12,440 --> 01:09:14,799
So, those reserves will start being

1511
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:17,000
paid, will start being paid, and they'll

1512
01:09:17,000 --> 01:09:19,240
start being depleted, and the

1513
01:09:19,240 --> 01:09:22,000
dollar price will start rising. So, it'll

1514
01:09:22,000 --> 01:09:24,440
be at a high level. At that

1515
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:25,799
high level of dollar price, the

1516
01:09:25,799 --> 01:09:27,679
imports will decrease, and

1517
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:29,359
exports will increase.

1518
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:32,799
And then, that will happen

1519
01:09:32,799 --> 01:09:35,440
while the the system

1520
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:37,520
balances again. What we have to reach, in

1521
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:39,239
all countries, is that we all must

1522
01:09:39,239 --> 01:09:41,840
be in balance, both internally and

1523
01:09:41,840 --> 01:09:45,359
externally. Then, at that moment,

1524
01:09:45,359 --> 01:09:48,040
we'll have maximum justice, all

1525
01:09:48,040 --> 01:09:50,480
countries with maximum development,

1526
01:09:50,480 --> 01:09:52,920
because they have their own resources,

1527
01:09:52,920 --> 01:09:56,000
they have their labor force, and they have their

1528
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,120
work to do. It's not fair to

1529
01:09:58,120 --> 01:10:03,159
have roads in very bad condition, and and

1530
01:10:03,159 --> 01:10:06,480
people unemployed, for lack of money.

1531
01:10:06,480 --> 01:10:08,719
Well, then, how does the part with

1532
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:10,320
government work? Notice that government

1533
01:10:10,320 --> 01:10:13,480
has its income and its

1534
01:10:13,480 --> 01:10:16,480
expenses: current income and the capital

1535
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:18,040
resource part, which are

1536
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,400
loans, they have to balance those

1537
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,840
expenses. Well.

1538
01:10:22,840 --> 01:10:25,719
When we make the issuance to

1539
01:10:25,719 --> 01:10:28,360
finance that part there,

1540
01:10:28,360 --> 01:10:32,760
that, that part of the deficit, that issuance

1541
01:10:32,760 --> 01:10:35,080
comes to make different types of

1542
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:38,000
works, to to complement, in addition to

1543
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,440
the money already circulating, in

1544
01:10:40,440 --> 01:10:42,560
addition to current income, there's some

1545
01:10:42,560 --> 01:10:45,400
additional income that's going to increase

1546
01:10:45,400 --> 01:10:47,719
the economy's money, and that allows

1547
01:10:47,719 --> 01:10:49,920
everyone to keep growing.

1548
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:52,800
So, we're going to make roads, schools,

1549
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:56,000
hospitals, transportation, aqueduct,

1550
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,960
sewerage, and we can do

1551
01:10:57,960 --> 01:11:00,199
reforestation and

1552
01:11:00,199 --> 01:11:02,239
decontamination, because what's

1553
01:11:02,239 --> 01:11:05,159
needed is people's work. The

1554
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:06,120
money,

1555
01:11:06,120 --> 01:11:08,600
look, can do everything you want.

1556
01:11:08,600 --> 01:11:13,080
So, this changes the discourse for us. That

1557
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,400
additional income the

1558
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:19,320
economy receives, no, it's not only for

1559
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,480
government, but these people who

1560
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:24,520
receive that of income, will also buy

1561
01:11:24,520 --> 01:11:26,719
from the other companies that are

1562
01:11:26,719 --> 01:11:30,920
there, from schools, from hospitals, from

1563
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:33,840
food, from clothing. The

1564
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:36,520
entire economy will move. We're, we're going to have

1565
01:11:36,520 --> 01:11:39,320
a multiplier factor. At the beginning, it's

1566
01:11:39,320 --> 01:11:41,280
possible we'll have demand-pull

1567
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:44,280
inflation, but over time, the

1568
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,040
companies, whose

1569
01:11:47,040 --> 01:11:49,520
interest rate has been lowered, then, will be able to

1570
01:11:49,520 --> 01:11:52,679
produce more. In fact, they'll produce more,

1571
01:11:52,679 --> 01:11:55,679
because they'll receive more sales. The

1572
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,719
companies' sales will increase

1573
01:11:57,719 --> 01:11:59,600
permanently. Every year they'll

1574
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:02,400
increase. There's no reason for there to be crises.

1575
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:05,239
Crises are fomented, they're

1576
01:12:05,239 --> 01:12:07,719
contrived. Right now, when

1577
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:10,120
we do that, permanently, we're not going to

1578
01:12:10,120 --> 01:12:13,199
have crises anymore. So, companies

1579
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:16,480
will, will have more profits, and they'll

1580
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:18,560
also increase their their

1581
01:12:18,560 --> 01:12:23,040
investment: more employment, more supply, less

1582
01:12:23,040 --> 01:12:26,600
inflation, more employment, more income, and

1583
01:12:26,600 --> 01:12:29,360
then, the economy will keep turning

1584
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:30,639
permanently

1585
01:12:30,639 --> 01:12:35,360
in a stable growth

1586
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:37,719
permanently, as the human

1587
01:12:37,719 --> 01:12:39,679
being deserves, I'd

1588
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:43,679
say. We've already gone through many stages of

1589
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:47,760
much suffering, much hunger, of

1590
01:12:47,760 --> 01:12:51,440
many problems and economic hardships, and

1591
01:12:51,440 --> 01:12:54,080
man, it's time for him to learn from

1592
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,679
his experience, and know that he can also

1593
01:12:56,679 --> 01:13:00,159
live happily in this, in this world. Here

1594
01:13:00,159 --> 01:13:02,320
is the solution to the economic problem.

1595
01:13:02,320 --> 01:13:06,120
Happiness, that will be an internal

1596
01:13:06,120 --> 01:13:09,040
problem for for each person, of religion,

1597
01:13:09,040 --> 01:13:11,480
perhaps, of people harmonizing with their

1598
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,280
own religion. But in the economic

1599
01:13:13,280 --> 01:13:15,760
part, resources can be harmonized

1600
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:18,800
so humanity lives

1601
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:23,280
perfectly well, without slaves, without, without

1602
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,440
wars. There's no reason for it

1603
01:13:27,440 --> 01:13:32,239
to happen. So, let's see what

1604
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:36,040
the policies told us. Which of all the

1605
01:13:36,040 --> 01:13:38,560
policies was the best? The Monetary

1606
01:13:38,560 --> 01:13:41,360
Fund's, that told us free market,

1607
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:43,159
that very high interest rates, that

1608
01:13:43,159 --> 01:13:47,000
fiscal deficit, no? Fiscal deficit, yes.

1609
01:13:47,000 --> 01:13:49,600
When they tell us fiscal deficit, no, they

1610
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:53,080
make us put the economy into a crisis.

1611
01:13:53,080 --> 01:13:55,639
When they tell us

1612
01:13:55,639 --> 01:13:58,120
debt, well, I just

1613
01:13:58,120 --> 01:14:02,120
showed you how all civilization can

1614
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:04,760
leave the debt problem, can

1615
01:14:04,760 --> 01:14:06,920
leave debt, and can live

1616
01:14:06,920 --> 01:14:09,920
happily, with all the resources it

1617
01:14:09,920 --> 01:14:13,679
desires. Money issuance, that the

1618
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:15,560
Monetary Fund told us shouldn't be done, and

1619
01:14:15,560 --> 01:14:18,840
we see that yes, it should be

1620
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:22,880
done. They give us Monetary

1621
01:14:22,880 --> 01:14:23,920
Fund

1622
01:14:23,920 --> 01:14:25,760
International policies. We

1623
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,520
saw it: reduce money, raise the

1624
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:30,840
interest rate, is taking us to a

1625
01:14:30,840 --> 01:14:34,080
crisis, inevitably.

1626
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:36,760
Let's discard, then, the economic

1627
01:14:36,760 --> 01:14:39,199
globalization policies the

1628
01:14:39,199 --> 01:14:41,639
International Monetary Fund sold us.

1629
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:44,360
We've been able to prove that, indeed,

1630
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:51,239
they're false, they're false, they're wrong.

1631
01:14:55,120 --> 01:14:58,199
Let's see this other aspect of the economic

1632
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:01,360
system in general, and basically, all

1633
01:15:01,360 --> 01:15:05,360
countries, let's say, that

1634
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,719
have the primary sector, the secondary

1635
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:12,840
sector, and, and the tertiary sector, in, in which

1636
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:14,400
all companies are managed for

1637
01:15:14,400 --> 01:15:17,159
mining, agriculture, livestock,

1638
01:15:17,159 --> 01:15:20,639
etcetera, the secondary sector, industries and

1639
01:15:20,639 --> 01:15:22,440
construction, the tertiary sector,

1640
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:26,000
banks, services, well, funds,

1641
01:15:26,000 --> 01:15:28,599
etcetera. Governments, generally,

1642
01:15:28,599 --> 01:15:30,880
have their executive, legislative, and

1643
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:34,080
judicial branch, and their control bodies, and

1644
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:38,000
have financial entities for

1645
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:42,320
supporting the different economic

1646
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,560
sectors, and have their central bank,

1647
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:48,679
which is the base, which is what produces

1648
01:15:48,679 --> 01:15:52,080
money, and we have here, on this side, the

1649
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:54,199
context of economic theory, which tells

1650
01:15:54,199 --> 01:15:58,159
us what we saw at the

1651
01:15:58,239 --> 01:16:02,239
beginning: income and production, the

1652
01:16:02,239 --> 01:16:04,199
quantitative equation of money, the

1653
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:08,239
velocity of circulation, and the money

1654
01:16:08,239 --> 01:16:10,600
supply, the interest rate, and

1655
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,600
controlling inflation.

1656
01:16:12,600 --> 01:16:15,000
Well, we already know that controlling

1657
01:16:15,000 --> 01:16:16,520
inflation, then, isn't going to be

1658
01:16:16,520 --> 01:16:18,800
raising the interest rate, but

1659
01:16:18,800 --> 01:16:21,080
eliminating the deposit rate, and

1660
01:16:21,080 --> 01:16:23,719
letting the intermediation rate, the

1661
01:16:23,719 --> 01:16:25,679
free market one, depending on the

1662
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:28,159
competition the different

1663
01:16:28,159 --> 01:16:31,199
banks make. What's important is this: that

1664
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,280
we

1665
01:16:32,280 --> 01:16:34,679
separated, and in general, in all

1666
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:37,600
countries, the management of the real

1667
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,719
variables of the economy was separated.

1667
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,760
It was given to the executive to

1668
01:16:43,760 --> 01:16:45,000
control them, and the monetary variables were

1669
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
given to the central bank to

1670
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:50,239
control them. And also, we handed over the

1671
01:16:50,239 --> 01:16:52,880
central bank to the independence

1672
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:55,679
of of private parties, that don't listen

1673
01:16:55,679 --> 01:16:59,480
to the executive. Well, why? Why was

1674
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:02,440
that need made? So that the central

1675
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:05,000
bank introduces money to

1676
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,679
through banks. So, the

1677
01:17:07,679 --> 01:17:10,480
process comes: the central bank makes

1678
01:17:10,480 --> 01:17:13,960
the money, delivers it to the banks, and

1679
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:16,719
the banks lend it to

1680
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:19,440
government. When we could make the money

1681
01:17:19,440 --> 01:17:22,320
directly, give it to government, without

1682
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:24,320
need for so much intermediation or so much interest

1683
01:17:24,320 --> 01:17:26,480
rate.

1684
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,320
We've already seen how money works.

1685
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:34,040
So, why did central banks

1686
01:17:34,040 --> 01:17:36,440
ask for independence? Well of course,

1687
01:17:36,440 --> 01:17:38,159
you can't imagine the business that

1688
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,679
moves when we do this. No, the

1689
01:17:40,679 --> 01:17:43,719
central banks, with control of the

1690
01:17:43,719 --> 01:17:46,960
money supply and interest rate, and

1691
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:49,960
indebting government, and when they indebt

1692
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:53,080
government, the go, the executive, to

1693
01:17:53,080 --> 01:17:55,719
be able to pay, well indebts everyone,

1694
01:17:55,719 --> 01:17:56,920
with

1695
01:17:56,920 --> 01:17:59,920
taxes. That's the procedure that

1696
01:17:59,920 --> 01:18:02,639
we must reject, and that we must change

1697
01:18:02,639 --> 01:18:05,040
for the new era of human

1698
01:18:05,040 --> 01:18:07,840
liberation. We have to reject that process

1699
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,120
that enslaves, and do our own,

1700
01:18:11,120 --> 01:18:13,239
directly. The central bank,

1701
01:18:13,239 --> 01:18:16,560
really, should be a wing of

1702
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,199
government, where government makes the

1703
01:18:20,199 --> 01:18:22,960
money the economy needs,

1704
01:18:22,960 --> 01:18:26,520
directly, without credit, without interest, and

1705
01:18:26,520 --> 01:18:29,000
distributes it to the economy, puts it into

1706
01:18:29,000 --> 01:18:31,960
circulation through the works of the

1707
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:35,159
executive, of infrastructure

1708
01:18:35,159 --> 01:18:37,400
works, or through its

1709
01:18:37,400 --> 01:18:40,080
different control bodies, that can

1710
01:18:40,080 --> 01:18:43,000
help the different companies.

1711
01:18:43,000 --> 01:18:45,760
And banking, how does it benefit from all

1712
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,159
this? In that government, when it receives

1713
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:50,400
money, government will use

1714
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:52,600
banking, anyway. It'll put the

1715
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:55,280
money in banking, and banking will be able to

1716
01:18:55,280 --> 01:18:57,960
distribute and lend to private parties,

1717
01:18:57,960 --> 01:19:00,840
but not indebting government or the

1718
01:19:00,840 --> 01:19:04,840
country directly. So, what happened with

1719
01:19:04,840 --> 01:19:08,199
our system when we separated it?

1720
01:19:08,199 --> 01:19:10,880
We committed a very big sin, because the

1721
01:19:10,880 --> 01:19:14,880
system is one. The system must be unique,

1722
01:19:14,880 --> 01:19:17,719
and all countries can do this

1723
01:19:17,719 --> 01:19:20,400
situation: reunite this, recover

1724
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,000
their central banks,

1725
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:26,960
and eliminate debt.

1726
01:19:26,960 --> 01:19:30,239
Well, I'd like to make an introduction of

1727
01:19:30,239 --> 01:19:32,880
what would be,

1728
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:37,440
then, the unique money on planet

1729
01:19:37,440 --> 01:19:40,080
Earth, under the same

1730
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:42,560
principle. Let's say, then, that this isn't

1731
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,760
a country, but that it's planet Earth,

1732
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:47,000
where we have an

1733
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:50,320
executive, the different sectors of the

1734
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,480
economy, and some control ones. Well it

1735
01:19:54,480 --> 01:19:58,480
means that the bank, no longer central,

1736
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:00,600
but at world level, we should

1737
01:20:00,600 --> 01:20:03,520
have a single bank. But a single bank

1738
01:20:03,520 --> 01:20:07,080
that wouldn't belong to any particular

1739
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:09,920
country, nor to any particular

1740
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:12,199
entity. It would belong to all

1741
01:20:12,199 --> 01:20:15,280
countries. Let's say all countries

1742
01:20:15,280 --> 01:20:18,760
could meet and make a single bank, and

1743
01:20:18,760 --> 01:20:22,320
that single bank would have to make an

1744
01:20:22,320 --> 01:20:25,840
annual distribution of money, change

1745
01:20:25,840 --> 01:20:27,520
in all countries the money for that

1746
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,639
single currency. That single bank would have to

1747
01:20:31,639 --> 01:20:36,000
give money each year to the new, to the

1748
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:37,800
countries, not as

1749
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,600
debt, but as: this is the equity that

1750
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,400
corresponds to you to spend

1751
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:44,880
this year, to increase your production in

1752
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:48,560
this year. And all countries could go

1753
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:51,760
tied to a, to a single inter-

1754
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:55,280
national currency, but with that equitable factor

1755
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:58,239
of giving each one their

1756
01:20:58,239 --> 01:21:01,719
corresponding monetary unit each

1757
01:21:01,719 --> 01:21:04,280
year, so they keep growing. And thus

1758
01:21:04,280 --> 01:21:07,040
we could establish a new economic

1759
01:21:07,040 --> 01:21:08,800
system

1760
01:21:08,800 --> 01:21:11,600
worldwide. How far could this be?

1761
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:15,320
Well, it depends on on how quickly

1762
01:21:15,320 --> 01:21:16,960
each country organizes, first,

1763
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,320
individually,

1764
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:23,880
so people level out, level out

1765
01:21:23,880 --> 01:21:25,600
in the, in the

1766
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:28,480
socioeconomic, we all have a

1767
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:31,120
balanced level of of life, and then, yes,

1768
01:21:31,120 --> 01:21:34,159
we could proceed to make the unique

1769
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:36,760
integrated system

1770
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,120
international. And in that way, perhaps,

1771
01:21:39,120 --> 01:21:42,960
legislation could be unified,

1772
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:46,840
being equitable for for everyone. We've

1773
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:52,920
finished the talk. It's Economic

1774
01:21:52,920 --> 01:21:55,600
Heresy, Protocols Toward a New

1775
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,800
Economic System. It depends on you

1776
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,880
to allow them not to keep stealing, not to

1777
01:22:01,880 --> 01:22:05,440
keep exploiting, not to

1778
01:22:07,560 --> 01:22:12,040
keep on. Well, it depends on you to win

1779
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:15,040
the new planet Earth, with the

1780
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:16,960
abundance we deserve, with the

1781
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:19,719
happiness we deserve. This is a

1782
01:22:19,719 --> 01:22:22,280
new scientific and systemic method for

1783
01:22:22,280 --> 01:22:25,239
economic theory. This is the first

1784
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:27,719
chapter of the book "Protocols Toward a

1785
01:22:27,719 --> 01:22:33,080
New Economic System". You were

1786
01:22:33,159 --> 01:22:39,000
addressed by Mauricio Rivadeneira Mora. It was a

1787
01:22:50,440 --> 01:22:53,440
pleasure.
