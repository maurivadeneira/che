known unknown

17
00:00:44,850 --> 00:00:48,929
The procedure is not random and you

18
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,260
We are also part of the All project

19
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:54,030
the systemic process the kit 2 te

20
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,579
includes all instructions and

21
00:00:54,030 --> 00:00:59,159
project philosophy is also a

22
00:00:56,579 --> 00:01:01,229
Book the product you acquire it to the

23
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:03,569
Corporation to a price fraction

24
00:01:01,229 --> 00:01:06,330
as long as you accept to turn the other

25
00:01:03,569 --> 00:01:07,080
Part who tells you in the same

26
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:09,780
application

27
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:12,210
as a solidarity turn in case of

28
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:14,490
accept to be included in this project to

29
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,620
know that the intention is that all

30
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,770
person can obtain a basic income

31
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:22,710
average monthly if you don't need this

32
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:24,780
basic we also need to

33
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,410
that you help others that sure if

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,410
They need

35
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:31,860
For many to have a basic is a

36
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,350
fortune because they have no options

37
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:36,840
Our society is sometimes very unfair

38
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:39,480
And with this project we will begin to

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,790
solve this social problem by

40
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,360
This requires the

41
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,510
Solidarity

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,480
This is a very important project and

43
00:01:46,510 --> 00:01:52,510
ambitious and invites you to think about

44
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:54,670
social function we are a unit that you

45
00:01:52,510 --> 00:01:57,490
A nail hurts your teeth all over your

46
00:01:54,670 --> 00:02:00,400
be true with society equal if

47
00:01:57,490 --> 00:02:03,430
Someone goes hungry you will feel it all

48
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:06,010
society we intend that each person

49
00:02:03,430 --> 00:02:08,619
can obtain your basic income from the

50
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:11,320
A short time after it is included and

51
00:02:08,619 --> 00:02:14,290
Acquire the works each person in everything

52
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:16,180
The world and we will achieve it without asking or

53
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:18,540
to the government or anyone only

54
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:21,370
We will generate through this mechanism

55
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:23,920
entirely social and without intermediaries

56
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:26,230
It is a systemic application and almost

57
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:28,050
immediately depends on the diligence of

58
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:30,600
each

59
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:32,820
And we hope to achieve it with a single work

60
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:35,310
that we expect to buy it again and again

61
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:38,640
every year because kit 2 has

62
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:40,470
evidence of one so no one will be the

63
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,390
last in the row and we can always

64
00:02:40,470 --> 00:02:45,510
get the objective that we can all

65
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,490
have a basic entry basic income

66
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,510
that we will improve introducing

67
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:53,960
Then Kit 3 and then other Kit 2 and 3

68
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,420
of other authors writers composers

69
00:02:53,960 --> 00:03:00,300
and artists the Energy Corporation

70
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:03,180
economic through its editorial

71
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:05,160
Virtual comes to see starting with

72
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:08,580
some authors writers composers

73
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:10,680
artists to publish their works and

74
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:12,510
Of course they can sell them through

75
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,780
of our website and this

76
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,760
mechanism of kit two and three when

77
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,940
you acquire a work in the terms of

78
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,770
This project you buy the works to the

79
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,260
corporation reduced but with the

80
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:28,020
commitment to be supportive with whom

81
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:30,750
It tells you later that you are supportive with

82
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,720
Someone the providence will also be

83
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:36,270
solidarity in the future when you acquire

84
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,910
Your custom kit 2

85
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:41,430
You send it for example to two people from

86
00:03:38,910 --> 00:03:43,660
Your direct family two or three of your

87
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,360
close relatives

88

more it is easy for you has been distributed

91
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:57,150
Do not forget the project is to make

92
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,830
Everyone can get their basic income

93
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:01,900
In general, a basic income is a

94
00:03:59,830 --> 00:04:04,330
Minimum salary That is what we intend

95
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:07,630
generate for each one without that

96
00:04:04,330 --> 00:04:10,390
mean a job or pension this

97
00:04:07,630 --> 00:04:12,880
We will achieve it with solidarity and with

98
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:15,130
The systems must supply your

99
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:17,320
information and open a bank account

100
00:04:15,130 --> 00:04:20,380
Well, everything will be done in accordance with the

101
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,510
law we know that for one it is this will be a

102
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:24,760
very important income and for others

103
00:04:22,510 --> 00:04:27,120
of the other world but this project

104
00:04:24,760 --> 00:04:30,700
You need all to include us

105
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,590
Those who do not need this income

106
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,950
that they obtain can channel it to

107
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:36,810
Help others

108
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,590
that others can be included in the

109
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:42,330
system and be part of the beneficiaries

110
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:45,090
first a basic and then improve

111
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:46,950
This basic want to enter our

112
00:04:45,090 --> 00:04:48,930
Click project click

113
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:52,440
What did you receive in my kit

114
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:55,320
2 and proceeds to make the purchase the system

115
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:58,440
It will take you step by step and to finish

116
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,330
This first part is missing to tell you about

117
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:02,400
The work that you are going to acquire energy

118
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:04,640
economic or the complete one that can

119
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,620
Interest or not even although personally

120
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:10,380
I want interest I will explain to you in

121
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:12,630
A short conference in the modules

122
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,430
following some economy so that

123
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:18,240
start understanding the economy and that

124
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:20,580
Be the introduction to the works I can

125
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,710
Ensure that it is not a heavy document

126
00:05:20,580 --> 00:05:24,940
I am the heretic of the economy and I want

127
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:27,730
that everyone understands economy

128
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:30,160
Understand the economy will allow us

129
00:05:27,730 --> 00:05:32,620
free us from many aspects both

130
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,740
materials as spiritual in

131
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:37,690
following videos you can feel the

132
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:41,020
Best of this project we give you the

133
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:43,150
Welcome one more thing

134
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:45,940
You must know that the corporation that

135
00:05:43,150 --> 00:05:48,340
directs these works is an entity that

136
00:05:45,940 --> 00:05:50,199
It has been created without profit

137
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:53,500
then the income you receive will be

138
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:56,259
invested in sustainable self -works that

139
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:58,960
The authors of

140
00:05:56,259 --> 00:06:00,099
The works will certainly receive their

141
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:03,009
copyright

142
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:07,389
The Corporation will pay salaries to its

143
00:06:03,009 --> 00:06:09,639
workers and by statutes will enter

144
00:06:07,389 --> 00:06:11,199
or very people will be invited

145
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:14,889
Specials to take administration

146
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,380
Impeccably the corporation does not

147
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:19,319
promotes free economy although

148
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:22,599
you can certainly get them

149
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:24,520
Free but you understand the economy

150
00:06:22,599 --> 00:06:27,400
free does not promote production and

151
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:30,039
Development countries with economics

152
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:31,810
Free stagnates for why we invite you

153
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:34,469
to acquire the works so that

154
00:06:31,810 --> 00:06:36,419
You can be part of the economic cycle

155
00:06:34,469 --> 00:06:39,669
That is why in our corporation

156
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:41,979
will recognize the price of things to

157
00:06:39,669 --> 00:06:43,629
that the tasks are self -sustainable and

158
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:45,580
also all activities that

159
00:06:43,629 --> 00:06:46,460
They undertake the corporation are social

160
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:50,180
commercial

161
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:52,669
are self -sustainable in most

162
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:55,099
I will look for cases we will look for all

163
00:06:52,669 --> 00:06:59,380
can acquire an income product of

164
00:06:55,099 --> 00:06:59,380
Your work is welcomed
