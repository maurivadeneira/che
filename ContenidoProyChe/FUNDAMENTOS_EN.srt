1
00:00:02,860 --> 00:00:05,820
A cordial greeting

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:13,150
Let's make a small presentation

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:16,090
of the fundamental principles of

4
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:21,029
economy to understand how

5
00:00:16,090 --> 00:00:21,029
Neoliberalism works

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:28,949
I'm Mauricio Rivadeneira a physique

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,439
economist author of a series of

8
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:34,440
writings that I have together

9
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:37,379
called economic energy one of the

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,600
books was called protocols towards a

11
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:43,000
New economic system

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:44,920
what has presented today and is

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:47,230
A scheme

14
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,719
very fast to understand the principles

15
00:00:47,230 --> 00:00:52,510
fundamentals of the economy we are going to

16
00:00:49,719 --> 00:00:54,989
Understand economy and we will understand

17
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:57,339
The light of those principles of the economy

18
00:00:54,989 --> 00:01:00,089
How is the

19
00:00:57,339 --> 00:01:00,089
neoliberalism

20
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:06,250
And you can clarify whether neoliberalism

21
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:09,240
truly

22
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:12,079
it's good or bad

23
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,750
Let's start with presenting our actors

24
00:01:12,079 --> 00:01:18,619
Let's talk about the gross domestic product the

25
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:18,619
gross domestic product

26
00:01:19,630 --> 00:01:24,360
We measure it through admission is

27
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:28,270
There in economics it will be called

28
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,829
national entrance that in its value will

29
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:31,470
be exactly the same as the product

30
00:01:29,829 --> 00:01:35,530
Gross internal

31
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:40,420
That income is obtained in the S

32
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:43,000
In the country all the people of the country

33
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,759
They have the sum of all those income

34
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:48,250
Gross Domestic Product gives us those

35
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,799
All income comes from

36
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:53,470
people who work in companies and

37
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,380
They win their salary in companies of the

38
00:01:53,470 --> 00:01:59,170
agriculture in industrial companies in

39
00:01:56,380 --> 00:02:01,509
Production service companies

40
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:04,920
of consumer goods and services and in

41
00:02:01,509 --> 00:02:09,830
Investment goods and services

42
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:13,790
that income that is obtained by working

43
00:02:09,830 --> 00:02:17,410
and also includes income from

44
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:22,930
Interest for capital income by the

45
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:25,670
Rent of shares for any concept

46
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,740
entry for all concepts and

47
00:02:25,670 --> 00:02:31,390
sum of all income gives us

48
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:31,390
The Gross Domestic Product

49
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,150
What do people do with their income

50
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:41,269
consume

51
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,930
consumes and what does not consume is what

52
00:02:41,269 --> 00:02:46,000
which has been called in economics elaborates

53
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:50,470
very good

54
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:52,060
This is a special square because

55
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:56,620
Always move like a perfect square

56
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,420
This is a square matrix where

57
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:03,220
The following conditions have the

58
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:06,670
consumer goods and services is equal to

59
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:10,360
what we are going to call consumption and

60
00:03:06,670 --> 00:03:13,360
investment is the same

61
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:16,120
This is always going to be given in all

62
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:19,110
The countries of the world measure the product

63
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:22,170
Gross internal in this way

64
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:24,990
And not only does this square tell us

65
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:27,170
These definitions but tells us

66
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,560
also how it works

67
00:03:27,170 --> 00:03:32,890
The economy can

68
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:37,590
In the time that stagnant or

69
00:03:32,890 --> 00:03:40,560
can shrink or can stretch

70
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:44,220
with a particularity always as a

71
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:46,330
Perfect square does not not move

72
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:49,530
So

73
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:52,380
Nor does it move like this

74
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:55,190
moves like a perfect square or

75
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:58,819
The economy can only shrink

76
00:03:55,190 --> 00:04:01,300
You can stay still or you can

77
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:03,640
enlarge

78
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,800
What interests us is that

79
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:07,670
economy is great always grow

80
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:09,800
grow up

81
00:04:07,670 --> 00:04:13,490
What is shrunk

82
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,860
Well then if you manage to see there

83
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:18,049
What happens when the economy shrinks

84
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,609
means that consumption is shrunk and

85
00:04:18,049 --> 00:04:22,759
Savings

86
00:04:19,609 --> 00:04:25,300
And when the community is stretched

87
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:28,449
Also consumption and savings

88
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,060
Well what we in the economy

89
00:04:28,449 --> 00:04:33,759
You always listen to politicians

90
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:36,159
talk is that you have to reduce the

91
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:39,000
consumption or that must increase the

92
00:04:36,159 --> 00:04:42,460
good consumption that is the practical part

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:44,979
When we reduce consumption what

94
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:47,740
They say lately in the neoliberal era

95
00:04:44,979 --> 00:04:49,930
is that the consumption of the

96
00:04:47,740 --> 00:04:52,659
Government then reduce consumption

97
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:55,090
of the government means shrinking the

98
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:57,039
economy or decrease when

99
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:59,680
We decrease consumption we decrease

100
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,710
simultaneously savings that wants

101
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:04,090
say that we decrease the investment and that

102
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:07,440
means that the domestic product

103
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:07,440
Gross also decreases

104
00:05:07,510 --> 00:05:10,780
It is not understood because politicians

105
00:05:09,340 --> 00:05:12,460
They say that the

106
00:05:10,780 --> 00:05:14,680
consumption economists say

107
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:17,500
reduce consumption the central bank

108
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:20,730
orders that consumption must be reduced

109
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:24,640
That makes no sense but no sense

110
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:28,409
- When we compare it and put the

111
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,590
population in that context

112
00:05:28,409 --> 00:05:33,740
We have

113
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:36,180
than the economy

114
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,790
In one of the initial conditions

115
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:41,640
We said we start at this point there are

116
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:44,610
an unemployed population outside

117
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,920
that of the economy then what

118
00:05:44,610 --> 00:05:49,470
We need to do is that consumption

119
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,449
grows grow until you reach and cover

120
00:05:49,470 --> 00:05:53,030
The entire population

121
00:05:51,449 --> 00:05:55,249
good

122
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:57,739
When we are like this

123
00:05:55,249 --> 00:06:00,529
In an initial situation in which

124
00:05:57,739 --> 00:06:03,049
There is important unemployment and they tell us

125
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:05,449
that consumption must be reduced as

126
00:06:03,049 --> 00:06:08,569
consumption means that we are going to

127
00:06:05,449 --> 00:06:12,469
also reduce savings also

128
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:16,490
investment and also income that is

129
00:06:12,469 --> 00:06:18,889
Let's give more unemployment people

130
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:21,319
That policy makes no sense is

131
00:06:18,889 --> 00:06:23,949
that it is impossible to be able to explain a

132
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:27,710
POLICY OF IS NEOLIBERALISM

133
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:30,500
That means shrinking the economy to

134
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:34,360
I count that it is not possible to understand a

135
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:34,360
situation of those good

136
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:45,720
This is only when it allows us to understand

137
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:48,510
how things move or the

138
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:53,330
income is consumed or saved on what

139
00:06:48,510 --> 00:06:58,140
proportion we would say about 180 20

140
00:06:53,330 --> 00:07:00,210
85 15 is that proportion the age

141
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:02,040
Economy result cannot be

142
00:07:00,210 --> 00:07:06,750
Choosing a priori does not cannot say

143
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:10,640
I will reduce consumption to increase

144
00:07:06,750 --> 00:07:13,410
Savings does not happen when I define

145
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:16,110
decrease consumption decreases

146
00:07:13,410 --> 00:07:19,710
Simultaneously savings then not

147
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:21,420
He has no regular saying that I am going to

148
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:24,120
decrease consumption to increase the

149
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:26,430
savings that did decrease that

150
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:29,220
Save these government practices in

151
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:30,550
We spend that savings on that

152
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:34,300
exists

153
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:36,130
does not exist does not work if the economy

154
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,760
This is the principle that just over them

155
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:40,900
narrate

156
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:40,900
It is a beginning

157
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:48,970
We should understand it as a law

158
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:50,920
Actually this was discovered by Peines

159
00:07:48,970 --> 00:07:52,490
Queines did not make this presentation of

160
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:55,090
This picture

161
00:07:52,490 --> 00:08:00,319
It happened a long time later for

162
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:02,180
made the leontief matrices and

163
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:04,639
I learned to handle this type of

164
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:06,889
pictures this type of matrices but

165
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:11,569
Queines discovered the operation of the

166
00:08:06,889 --> 00:08:13,970
system is so and since that time it is known

167
00:08:11,569 --> 00:08:15,440
that if decreased consumes it decreases

168
00:08:13,970 --> 00:08:18,620
Simultaneously savings and investment

169
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:21,470
And therefore also the income is

170
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:24,050
For a long time for the

171
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:27,440
most important economist of all

172
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:30,250
James times equivalent to a YouTube

173
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,250
In physics

174
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:36,279
because they forget this principle the

175
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:38,469
Economists are going to know why not

176
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:42,070
They understood or did not study what Inés

177
00:08:38,469 --> 00:08:45,700
But this is known for oratory

178
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:49,480
Economic for a long time of the

179
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:52,600
street times and well and

180
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:55,210
We present this picture then with the

181
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,360
Population actor the economy does not

182
00:08:55,210 --> 00:09:04,089
You have any meaning if we don't think about

183
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:08,580
In the population then we already know that

184
00:09:04,089 --> 00:09:08,580
In general this is the initial situation

185
00:09:08,889 --> 00:09:14,230
and unemployment what we

186
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:16,660
We would have to do is reach all the

187
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:20,290
population and from then on if

188
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:22,779
We can think that if we increase

189
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:25,209
consumption because things will go in

190
00:09:22,779 --> 00:09:29,649
inflation not as long as we are in

191
00:09:25,209 --> 00:09:33,269
That position one should not think about the

192
00:09:29,649 --> 00:09:35,990
inflation but we are in this situation

193
00:09:33,269 --> 00:09:38,600
initial

194
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:40,100
And there is inflation then what is what

195
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:42,320
that produces inflation we have to

196
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,470
Find out those things we will see more

197
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,470
forward

198
00:09:44,990 --> 00:09:51,080
We will withdraw our actor in this

199
00:09:47,180 --> 00:09:53,899
moment and then we are in our

200
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:55,550
conditions in the economy so that

201
00:09:53,899 --> 00:09:59,290
We can put to work

202
00:09:55,550 --> 00:10:02,139
We have to whistle then

203
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:05,139
here theoretically but how we do to

204
00:10:02,139 --> 00:10:06,899
increase consumption

205
00:10:05,139 --> 00:10:09,800
of a country

206
00:10:06,899 --> 00:10:13,220
Well we need to present another actor

207
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,220
The monetary mass

208
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:19,570
Primary money primary money

209
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:21,760
The mass is made in a central bank

210
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:25,090
monetary is much more general is the

211
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,650
M1 primary money more often so

212
00:10:25,090 --> 00:10:28,180
You are maximum four mansions five

213
00:10:26,650 --> 00:10:30,670
Six motions have invented

214
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:33,730
economists a series of terms but

215
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:37,080
The most important of two is the

216
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:41,830
Primary Issuance M1 The Monetary Base

217
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:47,580
When the monetary base grows

218
00:10:41,830 --> 00:10:47,580
All other more and grows too

219
00:10:48,670 --> 00:10:56,950
The country is a direct relationship between

220
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:59,110
that m 1 monetary base and growth

221
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:01,300
of consumption

222
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:05,850
If one makes that primary broadcast to

223
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:09,350
through government consumption

224
00:11:05,850 --> 00:11:09,350
The country grows

225
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:14,589
And that produces inflection is not true

226
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:16,540
understand first that this relationship

227
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:20,889
It has to exist for the economy

228
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:23,350
It is allowed to grow

229
00:11:20,889 --> 00:11:26,350
money supply through the base

230
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:29,609
monetary has to increase the

231
00:11:26,350 --> 00:11:29,609
monetary base M1

232
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,209
good

233
00:11:33,379 --> 00:11:42,730
that monetary base to increase

234
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:45,630
Well the monetary base increases

235
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:48,750
In two aspects basically

236
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,460
When the Central Bank increases the

237
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:53,700
loans to companies when

238
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:56,610
companies ask for more credit then there

239
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:58,800
The monetary base arises

240
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:01,019
The monetary base is moving in

241
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,750
all times sometimes the bank of the

242
00:12:01,019 --> 00:12:06,240
Republic enters but also returns

243
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:08,700
money to the Bank of the Republic as

244
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:10,440
Everything comes out as a loan and you must

245
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:12,899
then return for the credits there are

246
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:14,550
that then the base then

247
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:17,490
monetary is being renewed

248
00:12:14,550 --> 00:12:18,870
permanently between the money that is

249
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:22,620
in circulation and the bank of the

250
00:12:18,870 --> 00:12:24,300
Republic well what is needed is that

251
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,870
that monetary base that is in

252
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:31,260
circulation increased permanently

253
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:36,690
When this occurs, consumption increases and

254
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:41,329
then still increase the economy if to

255
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:45,519
opposite the monetary base is collected

256
00:12:41,329 --> 00:12:45,519
The economy contracts

257
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:52,089
In the 30s in the Great Depression

258
00:12:49,050 --> 00:12:55,000
It happened just that to the banks

259
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:58,389
centrals forgot that they had to

260
00:12:55,000 --> 00:13:01,779
produce money and then the system

261
00:12:58,389 --> 00:13:04,510
He started collecting all the money and came

262
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:07,570
a crisis to escape before when she

263
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,850
On that occasion they still did not have

264
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:13,570
Much knowledge of the economy happened

265
00:13:09,850 --> 00:13:16,209
that and the economy was left without money and

266
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:18,459
It was the great depression

267
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:22,420
the following depressions that we have

268
00:13:18,459 --> 00:13:24,689
had for the same cause exactly

269
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:24,689
because

270
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:31,040
increasing other elements that we are going to

271
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:33,980
Seeing later is because the system is

272
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:38,660
It is left without money and then comes the

273
00:13:33,980 --> 00:13:42,230
Well crisis then we know that

274
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:44,570
Among money the economy these

275
00:13:42,230 --> 00:13:48,530
basic economic principles and

276
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:51,860
population because everything is happening

277
00:13:48,530 --> 00:13:55,310
The phenomenon if money increases we can

278
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:58,780
Increase economy and we can go

279
00:13:55,310 --> 00:13:58,780
eliminating unemployment

280
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:04,310
Elemental will not ask

281
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:07,570
well and if it is so simple because the

282
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:07,570
government does not do that

283
00:14:07,740 --> 00:14:12,660
Ask the government they have

284
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:14,640
Other beliefs in economics have other

285
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:16,470
impositions what I am

286
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:18,529
explaining here is how the

287
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,019
Economic theory

288
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:22,910
And how should this be applied

289
00:14:21,019 --> 00:14:25,879
We are going to refresh the

290
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:27,589
concepts to economists and above all

291
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:29,600
to those of planning because because

292
00:14:27,589 --> 00:14:34,120
The

293
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,120
Principles of Economic Theory Good

294
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:42,180
What relationship we have between money and

295
00:14:39,130 --> 00:14:42,180
The interest rate

296
00:14:43,209 --> 00:14:50,660
Between these two there is a relationship

297
00:14:45,639 --> 00:14:54,379
Inverse if the interest rate increases

298
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:56,040
This makes money simultaneously

299
00:14:54,379 --> 00:14:58,440
decreases

300
00:14:56,040 --> 00:15:00,779
And of course when the interest rate

301
00:14:58,440 --> 00:15:03,300
increases and money thus decreases

302
00:15:00,779 --> 00:15:06,010
Economy contracts

303
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:08,440
And the crises will appear and it will

304
00:15:06,010 --> 00:15:12,280
Increase unemployment

305
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:14,350
This is very clear the principles if

306
00:15:12,280 --> 00:15:16,150
We understand the principles we understand

307
00:15:14,350 --> 00:15:18,250
How the economy works and yes

308
00:15:16,150 --> 00:15:20,110
We understand that we can control the

309
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:22,570
economy and towards which the

310
00:15:20,110 --> 00:15:24,970
service of people undoubtedly for

311
00:15:22,570 --> 00:15:32,079
That science

312
00:15:24,970 --> 00:15:35,230
That is why this is why this name

313
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:37,540
that we gave it economic energy because

314
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,930
the beliefs that started in

315
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:43,420
economies are different are not

316
00:15:40,930 --> 00:15:46,769
based on science science

317
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,769
This is that I am telling you

318
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:52,990
The first or heretics in the economy

319
00:15:49,570 --> 00:15:54,070
were the scientists here

320
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:56,730
We are too

321
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,730
scientists

322
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,730
good

323
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:03,730
other

324
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:10,620
So how can we make it increase

325
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:12,209
consumption through money but how

326
00:16:10,620 --> 00:16:15,660
We make money between

327
00:16:12,209 --> 00:16:18,840
Economy through the Government

328
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:22,170
through private companies and

329
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:24,840
In this the bank enters true the

330
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:27,060
entrance bank and receive the monies

331
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:30,690
from the Central Bank and the Banking

332
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:34,499
lend to individuals that

333
00:16:30,690 --> 00:16:36,809
It is made today I

334
00:16:34,499 --> 00:16:40,789
And there is something that is not

335
00:16:36,809 --> 00:16:44,699
enough that does not work very well

336
00:16:40,789 --> 00:16:46,709
because the economy is stagnant

337
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:48,599
population is unemployed then there are

338
00:16:46,709 --> 00:16:50,759
Something that doesn't work well for it

339
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:54,479
We have to bring the other actor the

340
00:16:50,759 --> 00:16:57,749
Government Budget The Budget

341
00:16:54,479 --> 00:17:00,629
of the government the government enters here

342
00:16:57,749 --> 00:17:03,059
box in this part of consumption in the

343
00:17:00,629 --> 00:17:05,610
production of a country the government is

344
00:17:03,059 --> 00:17:08,069
in all sectors in miracles in

345
00:17:05,610 --> 00:17:11,519
The industry in services and also

346
00:17:08,069 --> 00:17:13,299
produces consumer goods and services and

347
00:17:11,519 --> 00:17:16,119
investment

348
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:18,279
And then the government has a very

349
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,910
important in the participation of the

350
00:17:18,279 --> 00:17:21,860
economy

351
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:24,860
My government has to participate in the

352
00:17:21,860 --> 00:17:27,230
Economy is the way it makes it

353
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:30,200
can feed the economy and can

354
00:17:27,230 --> 00:17:33,370
reactivate and move the economy the country

355
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:37,180
Solito with individuals does not work

356
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:39,880
We need government finances

357
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:42,370
how they enter the government's finances

358
00:17:39,880 --> 00:17:44,890
The government has income that is

359
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:47,640
product of your taxes and you have some

360
00:17:44,890 --> 00:17:52,830
Expenses These expenses are generally

361
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:55,590
greater than those that income

362
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,750
what is greater is what you have to

363
00:17:55,590 --> 00:18:02,110
Cover with debt

364
00:17:57,750 --> 00:18:04,510
Then the country has to borrow

365
00:18:02,110 --> 00:18:08,110
The country borrows with private banking

366
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:10,330
But it could also borrow with the

367
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,809
Central Bank with your own bank

368
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:16,200
Central that worked in borrowing

369
00:18:13,809 --> 00:18:18,700
With its own central bank it worked in

370
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:21,220
The whole world

371
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:24,429
A long time the United States were

372
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:28,000
The first who began to that in that

373
00:18:24,429 --> 00:18:30,820
It is Colombia's operation also

374
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:34,419
He did to primary emissions

375
00:18:30,820 --> 00:18:37,770
of the central bank and we covered part of

376
00:18:34,419 --> 00:18:37,770
That deficit

377
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:44,470
Currently that deficit is done is

378
00:18:42,630 --> 00:18:46,960
regulated

379
00:18:44,470 --> 00:18:52,590
we would say by an invisible order of

380
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:56,760
CENTRAL BANK There is the thesis of D

381
00:18:52,590 --> 00:19:01,880
that the fiscal deficit is not superior

382
00:18:56,760 --> 00:19:04,950
at 3% the famous fiscal rule that 3% that

383
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:09,029
They say it is for growth

384
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:12,419
sustainable of countries does not give any

385
00:19:09,029 --> 00:19:15,809
Sustainable growth can be seen from

386
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:18,419
made the countries are well entering

387
00:19:15,809 --> 00:19:20,700
little by little in crisis because in terms

388
00:19:18,419 --> 00:19:23,600
What we have is that the country

389
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:28,490
He is contracting

390
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:31,730
Those SSD S Fiscal rule is poor

391
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:34,539
because 3% because not 5% because no

392
00:19:31,730 --> 00:19:34,539
7%

393
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:39,100
And that makes the debt grow and

394
00:19:37,330 --> 00:19:41,170
Then the debt must also pay it

395
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:44,710
And then good if he agrees to

396
00:19:41,170 --> 00:19:46,460
Here is very good that it comes 3% but

397
00:19:44,710 --> 00:19:51,560
It takes a

398
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:55,160
I would say an additional 2% an expense of 2%

399
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:57,350
that must come directly from the bank

400
00:19:55,160 --> 00:20:00,620
Central to the Government A Bank Credit

401
00:19:57,350 --> 00:20:03,620
central to the government in an additional 2%

402
00:20:00,620 --> 00:20:06,350
The fiscal rule must be added in

403
00:20:03,620 --> 00:20:08,690
that additional 2% of the domestic product

404
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:11,330
Gross no

405
00:20:08,690 --> 00:20:14,060
of possibility of indebtedness of

406
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:17,390
Nation Budget

407
00:20:14,060 --> 00:20:20,600
Every year that is what a

408
00:20:17,390 --> 00:20:22,910
expensive credit with banking but a

409
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:25,340
most friendly credit with the bank

410
00:20:22,910 --> 00:20:28,310
central for the purpose of doing

411
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:32,090
sustainable the economy so that the country

412
00:20:28,310 --> 00:20:35,420
can grow can feed all your

413
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:37,850
population the population to work

414
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:40,610
THE MECHANISM OF PRICE FREEDOM

415
00:20:37,850 --> 00:20:44,810
to work capitalism as

416
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:46,910
It must be when we do not do that expansion

417
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:49,010
of sufficient money

418
00:20:46,910 --> 00:20:50,570
Capitalism also works but

419
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:54,200
wildly because he starts

420
00:20:50,570 --> 00:20:58,029
contract and begin to be one one

421
00:20:54,200 --> 00:21:01,029
end of the story then

422
00:20:58,029 --> 00:21:04,559
The matter is that for capitalism

423
00:21:01,029 --> 00:21:09,399
function as it should be

424
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:13,090
more indebted to the system but a

425
00:21:09,399 --> 00:21:16,539
a good of that additional 2% with the

426
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:18,909
Central Bank Funds to the

427
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:21,860
Government to enter through

428
00:21:18,909 --> 00:21:25,970
Budget and the government can

429
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:28,730
include that in your income from expenses such as

430
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:32,780
someone's income for work produced

431
00:21:28,730 --> 00:21:35,840
For income and production are

432
00:21:32,780 --> 00:21:38,809
the same means that the offer and the

433
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:40,999
demand are the supply of goods

434
00:21:38,809 --> 00:21:44,059
and services

435
00:21:40,999 --> 00:21:46,099
and the demand or the income is

436
00:21:44,059 --> 00:21:47,899
The same are always the same then not

437
00:21:46,099 --> 00:21:50,139
there is to have inflation for that

438
00:21:47,899 --> 00:21:50,139
concept

439
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,830
unless the entire population is covered

440
00:21:54,060 --> 00:22:01,250
If the entire population is not covered

441
00:21:55,830 --> 00:22:06,110
inflation should appear then

442
00:22:01,250 --> 00:22:07,370
Because there is inflation we have to bring

443
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,490
here

444
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:13,700
The interest rate the interest rate

445
00:22:10,490 --> 00:22:16,370
that they use it says that for

446
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:18,110
Control inflation not the rate of

447
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:21,080
interest is not used to control

448
00:22:18,110 --> 00:22:27,020
Inflation The interest rate when it is

449
00:22:21,080 --> 00:22:30,380
above 12 percent is

450
00:22:27,020 --> 00:22:31,940
to get the monetary mass in what

451
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:34,640
form against monetary mass

452
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:38,270
When we have the interest rate then

453
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:42,070
Because people who have their income already

454
00:22:38,270 --> 00:22:46,060
It cannot be used for consumption but to

455
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:49,120
interest payment or a

456
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:51,430
Series of resources that no longer go to spending

457
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,370
Companies are no longer going to spend and

458
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:57,830
So that interest rate makes

459
00:22:54,370 --> 00:23:00,110
resources go to banks

460
00:22:57,830 --> 00:23:01,940
When we have an imbalance

461
00:23:00,110 --> 00:23:05,600
In our countries our countries

462
00:23:01,940 --> 00:23:08,149
underdeveloped have a rate of

463
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:11,350
high interest and European countries a

464
00:23:08,149 --> 00:23:13,490
Interest rate the countries are low

465
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:15,679
developed a short interest rate

466
00:23:13,490 --> 00:23:19,220
A transfer of

467
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:21,169
resources from less countries

468
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:22,700
developed to countries more

469
00:23:21,169 --> 00:23:25,279
developed that is why we don't

470
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:27,340
We can develop because with that rate

471
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:29,530
of interest

472
00:23:27,340 --> 00:23:33,130
the resources take away the rate of

473
00:23:29,530 --> 00:23:36,930
interest cannot be exceeding 2%

474
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:38,690
Annual Nominal

475
00:23:36,930 --> 00:23:40,820
2

476
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:44,150
Banks have to be put a limit

477
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:47,540
If we do not put a limit it is how it is

478
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:49,820
As if letting them be reproduced

479
00:23:47,540 --> 00:23:52,190
Many logos express how it was

480
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:54,500
all genres and destroy the

481
00:23:52,190 --> 00:23:56,210
System to banks have to be put a

482
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:58,730
limit because they cannot

483
00:23:56,210 --> 00:24:00,740
destroy the system with the rate of

484
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:03,410
interest they use to generate

485
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:07,460
Crisis not to control inflation

486
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:09,330
That really is not true the rate of

487
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:13,080
interest

488
00:24:09,330 --> 00:24:17,100
If it is short there, it is already controlling in

489
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:19,320
Inflation well then we have

490
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:22,680
presented the principles

491
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:24,270
fundamental of the economy and now already

492
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:27,810
We know how the economy works

493
00:24:24,270 --> 00:24:32,160
and that mistakes are being made

494
00:24:27,810 --> 00:24:34,290
neoliberalism is that

495
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:38,950
permanently reduce consumption

496
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:41,200
When we say that to reduce the

497
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:43,170
salary to congressmen that is

498
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:45,630
decrease consumption

499
00:24:43,170 --> 00:24:48,090
When we say take out the overtime

500
00:24:45,630 --> 00:24:52,740
That is to reduce the

501
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:55,770
consumption when we say pensioners

502
00:24:52,740 --> 00:24:58,220
They want to take away that is to reduce the

503
00:24:55,770 --> 00:24:58,220
consumption

504
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:08,190
if from the 45 to 70 or less

505
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:11,010
economies expanded after him

506
00:25:08,190 --> 00:25:14,010
of the 90s with neoliberalism we have

507
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:16,950
begun a permanent contraction that

508
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:20,400
Very critical criticism is already made because

509
00:25:16,950 --> 00:25:23,100
We have very large unemployment we have

510
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,680
a population that this population when

511
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,680
is out because they remain in the

512
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:30,810
fight for survival then

513
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:32,850
The underground community comes in the

514
00:25:30,810 --> 00:25:36,060
Drug economy comes the economy

515
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:38,540
of the robbery the robbery because why

516
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:41,430
because they are looking for how to survive is

517
00:25:38,540 --> 00:25:44,559
impossible that is the mechanism for

518
00:25:41,430 --> 00:25:47,889
destroy a nation

519
00:25:44,559 --> 00:25:51,080
An absurd fiscal rule

520
00:25:47,889 --> 00:25:53,870
That fiscal rule must be reviewed

521
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:55,399
I hope you make this viral

522
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:57,290
Video for everyone to understand

523
00:25:55,399 --> 00:26:00,140
because

524
00:25:57,290 --> 00:26:02,780
The principles of the

525
00:26:00,140 --> 00:26:04,880
economic theory will begin to apply the

526
00:26:02,780 --> 00:26:08,600
principles of economic theory as

527
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:11,180
It must be and hope that with this short

528
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:13,880
Video you begin to understand the

529
00:26:11,180 --> 00:26:15,470
Economy macroeconomy and what in

530
00:26:13,880 --> 00:26:18,950
Action Governments really for

531
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:21,380
work do not forget one limit

532
00:26:18,950 --> 00:26:25,220
to the bankers one that the rate of

533
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:27,170
interest is never exceeding 2% or

534
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:30,260
nominal that banks can only play

535
00:26:27,170 --> 00:26:33,680
within 0 and 2% that is already a lot

536
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:36,710
It should be less between 0 and 1%

537
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:39,470
It is the limit to put the

538
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:43,100
central banks and two that the money that

539
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:45,770
The money supply la m1

540
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:48,410
Primary money supply

541
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:50,900
primary

542
00:26:48,410 --> 00:26:53,840
credits of central banks to

543
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:56,260
Government that was prohibited precisely

544
00:26:53,840 --> 00:26:57,630
With the Constitution

545
00:26:56,260 --> 00:27:00,610
With the new constitutions

546
00:26:57,630 --> 00:27:02,710
neoliberals in all countries in

547
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:07,840
Colombia that projection is in the

548
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:12,160
Article 373 must be reforming that

549
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:14,530
Constitution article 373 must be

550
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:16,060
limit them the interests of

551
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:18,220
bankers must not allow the

552
00:27:16,060 --> 00:27:22,000
bankers play with the interest rate

553
00:27:18,220 --> 00:27:24,970
Because they peel all companies

554
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:27,280
These are the general principles that

555
00:27:24,970 --> 00:27:30,520
I wanted to share with you I hope

556
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:34,090
They understand me and see the importance of

557
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:35,830
The books that I present to you in

558
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:37,930
The economic heresy do not forget this

559
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:40,060
economic guide name is not because

560
00:27:37,930 --> 00:27:41,710
Let's be sorcerers it's because we love each other

561
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:45,280
Back science scientists

562
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:47,470
economic that is currently not

563
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:50,170
scientist currently apply a

564
00:27:47,470 --> 00:27:51,820
series of concepts that have already been forgotten

565
00:27:50,170 --> 00:27:54,430
totally of the principles of the

566
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:56,110
economic theory we want

567
00:27:54,430 --> 00:27:58,540
THE PRINCIPLES OF THE THEORY RETURN

568
00:27:56,110 --> 00:28:01,720
economic that knowledge returns

569
00:27:58,540 --> 00:28:07,080
of the knowledge of science and that we apply

570
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:09,640
science for what reason you want

571
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:11,740
Delete population wants to destroy the

572
00:28:09,640 --> 00:28:14,110
population to decrease the

573
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:16,000
Population does not make sense here we fit

574
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:19,210
