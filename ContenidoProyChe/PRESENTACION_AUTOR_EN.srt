00:00:05,900 --> 00:00:08,590
hello

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,440
I am with you to share this

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:18,650
project

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:23,330
I am the creator of the Energy Corporation

5
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:25,550
economic and project and some

6
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,740
Economics books

7
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:31,009
And what I want to share with this video

8
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:32,419
With you is how this was formed

9
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:34,760
project

10
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:37,370
This project is for everyone to

11
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,450
society we can form a

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:44,270
Basic income

13
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:44,270
And that we can generate it all

14
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:48,460
And I want to tell you how the

15
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:51,460
project

16
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:55,860
And please have in my patience I am not

17
00:00:51,460 --> 00:01:00,629
I am not an actor I am a simple

18
00:00:55,860 --> 00:01:00,629
Systems creator

19
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:10,750
In principle I want to tell you that

20
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:12,880
That arose as in the story I go

21
00:01:10,750 --> 00:01:15,010
To tell the story a little the genesis

22
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:16,260
of the project that begins with my own

23
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:19,260
life

24
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:22,590
In my childhood I always felt very

25
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:25,200
alone and very out of society and for

26
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:29,160
I would say that as from early

27
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,070
as a challenge to be able to understand

28
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:34,560
Society to understand where

29
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,770
I was moving and of course I could

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:40,620
include in this world

31
00:01:36,770 --> 00:01:42,950
I felt about another planet from another

32
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:46,070
And then

33
00:01:42,950 --> 00:01:49,039
It was difficult but this marked me because

34
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:52,280
This told me that I just wanted me

35
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:54,010
would settle for the truth with knowing how

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:57,700
It was the world

37
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:59,740
And I undoubtedly gave myself

38
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:01,800
Everything one observed in the world

39
00:01:59,740 --> 00:02:04,530
was

40
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:07,050
Well there were very happy things hopefully one

41
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,780
I could say that they are all happy but

42
00:02:07,050 --> 00:02:12,900
There were very sad things and one always

43
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:14,880
I felt a lot of real pain so many

44
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:18,690
difficulties and so hungry in the

45
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:22,080
planet because I wanted to study a little

46
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:24,510
of laws of laws of nature and by

47
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,410
I started studying physics in the

48
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:31,690
physics

49
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:33,850
Well, I was not so interested so much

50
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:36,220
Physics of things and of course that was very

51
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,770
interesting for me but I don't know why

52
00:02:36,220 --> 00:02:42,220
Reason centers me a lot on the

53
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:45,070
Construction of theories that that

54
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:49,420
I fascinated me is an emphasis not to see what it was like

55
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:54,060
The theoretical context of mechanics

56
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:57,060
classic of electromagnetism of

57
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:57,060
the

58
00:02:57,140 --> 00:03:04,140
and quantum mechanics and relativity

59
00:03:01,580 --> 00:03:06,060
Special the generalized I did not reach

60
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:11,250
Get so far

61
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:15,120
and I made four semesters of physics and

62
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:18,030
soon despite no longer

63
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,220
They needed to know more about that field

64
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,319
It was exactly my field to dedicate my

65
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:25,130
life there and felt it as something

66
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,840
transitory and I think there is complete

67
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:29,620
Complete a cycle

68
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:33,540
and then

69
00:03:29,620 --> 00:03:33,540
go to study economy

70
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:39,160
That was my field of society that I

71
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:43,230
The one who wanted

72
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:43,230
Understand the one who could put me

73
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:52,299
In the life of planet Earth Good

74
00:03:47,799 --> 00:03:56,230
I was studying economy and my surprise

75
00:03:52,299 --> 00:03:58,209
is that from the first class not

76
00:03:56,230 --> 00:04:02,780
I understood anything

77
00:03:58,209 --> 00:04:06,709
I didn't know where the economy was going

78
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:09,590
a really very tortuous hotel

79
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:12,680
You learn by heart and learn to recite

80
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:16,400
What they tell you without understanding

81
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:19,780
An attempt to understand good

82
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:19,780
And turns

83
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:25,280
I did not understand my teachers after

84
00:04:22,820 --> 00:04:28,310
of not building any judgment in the

85
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:30,340
texts I went to the texts did not understand him

86
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:34,240
The texts

87
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:37,690
The semesters were passing and I did not

88
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,850
I found feet and head to the economy and

89
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:42,580
Finally I did not have to study in the

90
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:45,460
who created all this story to see how

91
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:49,000
It is eating the thing and good when

92
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:54,130
I was studying John Maynard Keynes

93
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:58,060
main main main

94
00:04:54,130 --> 00:05:00,370
All the theorists of the economy

95
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:03,889
And there the world began to change me

96
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:07,219
Because I started understanding the economy

97
00:05:03,889 --> 00:05:09,050
I began to understand that Geithner although

98
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:12,460
He was mathematician was one of the first

99
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:14,670
He tried to enter the world

100
00:05:12,460 --> 00:05:18,090
phenomenological

101
00:05:14,670 --> 00:05:19,850
more seemed to how physics acts

102
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:23,460
intended to be a scientist

103
00:05:19,850 --> 00:05:25,980
Truly in the sense of power

104
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,280
[__] The real world the economy

105
00:05:25,980 --> 00:05:29,720
Economic theory

106
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:32,150
[Music]

107
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:36,080
take the real world but create some

108
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:39,290
models that are too unreal good

109
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:42,200
This is not a sin of the same

110
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:44,030
Physics also creates models that are not

111
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,730
very real to understand very

112
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:48,920
real but in the end he always returns and

113
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:51,980
Find the economy with reality

114
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:54,020
It does not happen to the economy creates in a

115
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:56,600
artificial world and stay in that

116
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:58,190
artificial world and then does not land in

117
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:00,480
The real world

118
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:06,249
There are very few who understand

119
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:09,519
Real the real world very very little

120
00:06:06,249 --> 00:06:12,939
Economic theory is lost in that

121
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:15,939
MaraÃ±a of things

122
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:18,909
And not not the real world is lost

123
00:06:15,939 --> 00:06:20,799
It was definitely what I could not

124
00:06:18,909 --> 00:06:23,439
Understand when John Maynard studies

125
00:06:20,799 --> 00:06:26,259
Keynes began to understand and started

126
00:06:23,439 --> 00:06:28,899
speak a language that then my

127
00:06:26,259 --> 00:06:32,920
teachers did not understand my

128
00:06:28,899 --> 00:06:36,639
companions a little more

129
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:38,949
And I started realizing that

130
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:43,020
Texts The theorists of the economy

131
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:43,020
Nor did they understand many things

132
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:50,870
They intended to enter those phenomena but

133
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:55,100
They always left a

134
00:06:50,870 --> 00:06:58,400
Little a bit lost for example to

135
00:06:55,100 --> 00:07:01,040
Putting an example is very key

136
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,389
The Texts of Economics and you

137
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:04,920
may check can start

138
00:07:02,389 --> 00:07:07,320
Any economy text

139
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:10,230
to verify that inflation

140
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:12,830
produces monetary issuance then in

141
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:16,020
A chapter tell him how we will see more

142
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:18,780
Back we will explain more in the

143
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:23,480
following chapters inflation

144
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:23,480
produces good monetary issuance

145
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:30,300
more or less things and then when

146
00:07:26,979 --> 00:07:33,430
They go to the chapter where they will explain

147
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:35,229
that inflation produces what they say

148
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:37,720
There is and how we told them before

149
00:07:35,229 --> 00:07:42,610
Inflation produces it

150
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:44,919
Notice that in the clouds it is like a

151
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:47,560
paradigm you next believe crea

152
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:49,350
in that because not in the form of purchase of

153
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:53,700
Check that

154
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:58,320
And well I penetrate that point and

155
00:07:53,700 --> 00:08:03,330
They know that if there is a way to check it

156
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:08,840
And they know something else is good lie

157
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,840
When I went and finally

158
00:08:08,860 --> 00:08:14,840
In that step of the economy

159
00:08:12,729 --> 00:08:18,020
I graduated

160
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:20,840
that there is between its two worlds a

161
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:23,360
economic theory that an economy that does not

162
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:26,270
I was useful for me and it can't be

163
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:28,639
I finished the baccalaureate and I don't know how to do

164
00:08:26,270 --> 00:08:31,940
Nothing and I finished the economy career and

165
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:36,950
Nor do you do anything that happened like

166
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:39,589
What world is this and then arrived with

167
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:42,890
Bombs and Surs The Neoliberalism

168
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:45,610
and Colombia in 1991 in the world a

169
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:45,610
little before

170
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,450
And it is not said, the story is over

171
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:54,360
The story for me because of some

172
00:08:51,450 --> 00:08:58,279
way I also believed a bit in that

173
00:08:54,360 --> 00:09:01,790
of good neoliberalism

174
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:04,730
That came neoliberalism but

175
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:08,040
A few days he had a crisis

176
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:10,740
A crisis because I had my thought

177
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:13,370
scientific type if a crisis arrived

178
00:09:10,740 --> 00:09:17,370
because that crisis should not be presented

179
00:09:13,370 --> 00:09:19,259
We were in a new context and

180
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:21,930
supposes that was going to take us off from

181
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:25,050
No world I started to review all

182
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:27,930
The concepts because I said if there is a

183
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:30,389
crisis is because something we have bad in the

184
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:34,459
Thought of economic theory and

185
00:09:30,389 --> 00:09:34,459
medium or to look for that and

186
00:09:34,750 --> 00:09:40,330
I found

187
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:40,330
With help but I found it

188
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:45,650
After that crisis of neoliberalism

189
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:47,870
So I could write my first

190
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:50,450
Book Economic Theory How to Control

191
00:09:47,870 --> 00:09:53,080
Interest rates inflation

192
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:53,080
Mondorous offer

193
00:09:54,089 --> 00:09:59,059
expectations and uncertainty in

194
00:09:57,269 --> 00:10:02,179
The economy

195
00:09:59,059 --> 00:10:06,589
And well I went to show that to the world

196
00:10:02,179 --> 00:10:10,149
I put my conference and went for

197
00:10:06,589 --> 00:10:10,149
Universities to see what

198
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:15,770
Everything happy I found the solution

199
00:10:13,279 --> 00:10:17,690
For the world and reached

200
00:10:15,770 --> 00:10:20,590
Universities

201
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:20,590
And very bad

202
00:10:21,290 --> 00:10:26,300
We said that if they had a tomato

203
00:10:24,019 --> 00:10:29,410
I would have entity

204
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:32,089
more or less like this

205
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:34,459
In the main universities of

206
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:37,860
Colombia not only exposes people

207
00:10:34,459 --> 00:10:41,459
of very recognized international renown

208
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:44,490
Here you are trying to tell me that

209
00:10:41,459 --> 00:10:46,560
You are right and the Central Bank

210
00:10:44,490 --> 00:10:48,000
Universities and everyone is

211
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,200
mistaken

212
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,930
Well I understood that

213
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:57,180
In the economy there is really no interest

214
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:00,150
for the fundamental concepts of the

215
00:10:57,180 --> 00:11:01,800
Economy there is no discussion that

216
00:11:00,150 --> 00:11:04,890
We could truly call

217
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:07,110
scientist does not exist what exists are

218
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:08,769
what is created and what everyone

219
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,470
Learn

220
00:11:08,769 --> 00:11:14,470
And he already learned by heart and those who

221
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:16,420
They prescribed the thing and made renown

222
00:11:14,470 --> 00:11:18,850
International those are the ones that arise

223
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:20,760
But discuss the principles of the

224
00:11:18,850 --> 00:11:23,820
Economic theory

225
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:26,090
1 percent of 1 percent of

226
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,090
researchers

227
00:11:27,329 --> 00:11:31,329
It is difficult

228
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:34,310
Economic theory is very difficult

229
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:37,339
because they are captured as they gave me so

230
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:40,940
Hard I confess that it gave me very hard

231
00:11:37,339 --> 00:11:43,670
very hard very hard sent me to the basement to

232
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:45,970
basement of existence

233
00:11:43,670 --> 00:11:51,470
I started thinking a lot

234
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:54,230
And I started finding things to

235
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:57,500
really realize the world how

236
00:11:54,230 --> 00:12:00,920
is that it works and well I can not one

237
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:04,370
Avoid meeting the Jews with

238
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:07,190
The Illuminatis with the Aryan race and that

239
00:12:04,370 --> 00:12:09,710
He started to go around my head

240
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,310
I realized that the world really

241
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:12,310
directs

242
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:19,100
The illuminati the illuminatis are like

243
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:22,340
a very attractive name that were put

244
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:26,450
The Jews Jews are a race

245
00:12:22,340 --> 00:12:29,090
Very special these sites investigate

246
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:31,820
in depth nature are the creators

247
00:12:29,090 --> 00:12:33,740
of all the fundamental theories that

248
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:37,250
there are in all fields

249
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:39,640
In physics it is on YouTube is in

250
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,640
plan

251
00:12:39,939 --> 00:12:44,360
all

252
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:47,660
Today these are Jews

253
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:50,029
There is not a single several for someone giving

254
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:52,450
rounds in the deep theory of

255
00:12:50,029 --> 00:12:52,450
things

256
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,990
in

257
00:12:54,270 --> 00:13:02,899
Psychology are already Freud Jung

258
00:12:58,990 --> 00:13:06,910
All Nietzsche

259
00:13:02,899 --> 00:13:09,430
very very deep that what a wonder of

260
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:14,170
Terrace today are researchers

261
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:16,560
They are illuminated and certainly

262
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:19,779
Only they always win

263
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:24,480
A bitter ratic because they are a bit

264
00:13:19,779 --> 00:13:24,480
little bit they know

265
00:13:24,579 --> 00:13:28,350
of life are creators of the

266
00:13:26,709 --> 00:13:30,990
religions in

267
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:34,380
In their great book they have only two

268
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:37,800
Trees The Tree of Science of Good

269
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:40,710
and from evil they represented the brain and the

270
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:44,180
Tree of life represented in the

271
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:46,910
life force

272
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:49,760
That the trees then handle

273
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:51,920
The world with much knowledge and with

274
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:54,790
a lot of strength

275
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,790
decoration

276
00:13:56,070 --> 00:14:02,020
And that nature

277
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:05,140
But the matter is that they could be better

278
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:07,450
Because the world could be friendlier

279
00:14:05,140 --> 00:14:09,070
Why do so much have to create

280
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,700
violence

281
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:15,160
Violence is created by people

282
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:18,460
inside because we come from an evolution

283
00:14:15,160 --> 00:14:21,850
of very animals

284
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:24,850
Survival and we are still in

285
00:14:21,850 --> 00:14:26,769
That world of survival does not believe

286
00:14:24,850 --> 00:14:30,309
no

287
00:14:26,769 --> 00:14:36,029
Well, I realized that the ARIA race in

288
00:14:30,309 --> 00:14:40,239
change are magical creators them

289
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:43,059
create and create and leave noses with

290
00:14:40,239 --> 00:14:45,519
His creations and do not correct citizen

291
00:14:43,059 --> 00:14:49,329
In the background they are not able to understand

292
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:53,279
a global context only theirs

293
00:14:49,329 --> 00:14:57,360
the same and then go out there

294
00:14:53,279 --> 00:15:00,129
Illuminati exams in that context

295
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:02,739
They create the systems create the

296
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:05,819
beliefs and airs

297
00:15:02,739 --> 00:15:09,699
apply as loquitos as blind

298
00:15:05,819 --> 00:15:13,119
So I don't know why

299
00:15:09,699 --> 00:15:15,190
created finally created the new

300
00:15:13,119 --> 00:15:17,920
liberalism

301
00:15:15,190 --> 00:15:20,860
and they sold it with bombs and saucers and

302
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,960
The Aryans went from noses in their

303
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:26,470
knowledge but they don't have the

304
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:30,280
ability to correct or do not

305
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:32,560
They have it in their DNA then if there is

306
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:35,560
Errors don't matter. They continue and continue

307
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:38,320
They say and the world is going to fall to

308
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,050
Aryans because the illuminats are

309
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:42,940
distant and they go to Pich are going to

310
00:15:41,050 --> 00:15:44,160
pique because neoliberalism was a

311
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:47,160
deception

312
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:50,129
And about what I discovered in the

313
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:52,889
investigations neoliberalism is a

314
00:15:50,129 --> 00:15:55,230
system that makes it fall more

315
00:15:52,889 --> 00:15:58,199
I explain a little in another

316
00:15:55,230 --> 00:16:00,899
Conference later very short of the

317
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:03,660
economic principles and

318
00:16:00,899 --> 00:16:07,379
neoliberalism in this same series of

319
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:09,509
conferences and I show them how in shape

320
00:16:07,379 --> 00:16:11,830
very elementary using the things that

321
00:16:09,509 --> 00:16:14,260
They taught us

322
00:16:11,830 --> 00:16:18,070
James in the economy know that this is

323
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:23,970
another Jew and all the Nobel Prizes of

324
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:23,970
Economy are very good Jews

325
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:32,510
The only bad thing is that no no

326
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:34,880
They recognized the other tree in the

327
00:16:32,510 --> 00:16:38,270
That is him

328
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,449
The heart of the three trees and

329
00:16:38,270 --> 00:16:42,699
The brain the heart

330
00:16:40,449 --> 00:16:45,040
Sexual organs are the three

331
00:16:42,699 --> 00:16:48,189
trees in Eden and share

332
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:52,589
Its roots in where they are in the

333
00:16:48,189 --> 00:16:52,589
spine and social union

334
00:16:52,670 --> 00:16:57,820
It is the same as up downward

335
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:57,820
so

336
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:05,270
So well

337
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,290
I discovered what the laws of

338
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,060
comics

339
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:10,520
And I said I will not win nobel

340
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,530
With my economic laws and know that

341
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:16,429
When I read the protocols of the wise

342
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:19,559
From Zion I saw all my Sainz laws

343
00:17:16,429 --> 00:17:22,399
For a long time but never

344
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,399
They have explained them

345
00:17:23,389 --> 00:17:30,029
In protocols right there and without any

346
00:17:26,490 --> 00:17:32,830
country should borrow it and I already know that

347
00:17:30,029 --> 00:17:36,130
No country should borrow

348
00:17:32,830 --> 00:17:37,269
Aryans do not know do not understand not

349
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:39,610
who is not

350
00:17:37,269 --> 00:17:45,809
They don't want her even to believe good

351
00:17:39,610 --> 00:17:45,809
So they work then I realized that

352
00:17:47,010 --> 00:17:51,809
that the world will not change

353
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:54,149
If people do not assimilate a bit of the

354
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:56,250
economic theory today all

355
00:17:54,149 --> 00:17:59,190
world has assimilated a lot of science

356
00:17:56,250 --> 00:18:02,710
physical with the same slowness will go

357
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:05,810
assimilating the economic science

358
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:09,680
And I hope to form fast

359
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:11,510
my part of my grain of sand in that

360
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:14,870
divulgation

361
00:18:11,510 --> 00:18:16,970
And I know that the same economy is not easy

362
00:18:14,870 --> 00:18:19,040
that any other science you have

363
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,510
to see it again and again and another

364
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:22,640
time while it goes down

365
00:18:20,510 --> 00:18:24,320
finally assimilating what the

366
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,130
Theoretical context and like that context

367
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,470
practical

368
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:30,320
I gave myself to the task of disseminating my

369
00:18:28,470 --> 00:18:32,179
thought

370
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:35,779
I set my conference and went for the

371
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:38,230
Yale Tree Hill universities and

372
00:18:35,779 --> 00:18:38,230
so

373
00:18:39,040 --> 00:18:44,850
When you study economy and want

374
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:47,170
look how things are disclosed because no

375
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:49,590
inevitably one meets the

376
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:52,130
Pyramid study

377
00:18:49,590 --> 00:18:54,090
How interesting those pyramids

378
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:57,659
Very interesting

379
00:18:54,090 --> 00:19:00,840
because well I don't try

380
00:18:57,659 --> 00:19:03,000
even belong to a pyramid but

381
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:06,240
I was fascinated by the way she

382
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:08,700
propagate there is reflected all passion

383
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:11,330
of pure man to enrich themselves that

384
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:13,730
It's amazing is a passion

385
00:19:11,330 --> 00:19:15,559
difficult is what this passion is what

386
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:19,960
holds

387
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:22,900
capitalism among others the desire for

388
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:25,180
get in the human being

389
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:27,130
as so irrational not beyond

390
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:29,950
anything is a desire to

391
00:19:27,130 --> 00:19:32,440
enrich themselves and pyramids have that

392
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:35,590
attractive but how the

393
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:37,780
Pyramid or one thing are passions

394
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:40,200
And another thing is the little angel who

395
00:19:37,780 --> 00:19:40,200
They put

396
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:45,580
I stayed by this is how

397
00:19:43,890 --> 00:19:49,090
It spreads

398
00:19:45,580 --> 00:19:51,910
Let's say there is a part of the dissemination

399
00:19:49,090 --> 00:19:56,250
of that of that thought that can be

400
00:19:51,910 --> 00:20:00,240
spin to easily spread

401
00:19:56,250 --> 00:20:05,130
It is not the pyramid not the pyramid that of

402
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:07,320
put a talk to get an income

403
00:20:05,130 --> 00:20:10,470
and that with the entry of another they pay him

404
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:12,480
A month and well that pod to risk the

405
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:16,000
capital

406
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:19,600
But if it served me to find a

407
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:22,200
artifice that people could do what

408
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:25,080
I am proposing

409
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:27,600
buy some books that bought a

410
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,610
Book does not mean that you will be the

411
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,150
investment of your life you are going to buy

412
00:20:29,610 --> 00:20:34,680
some books and will help

413
00:20:32,150 --> 00:20:36,980
promote them and in that way in the

414
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:40,280
measure

415
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:44,120
They are buying their books

416
00:20:40,280 --> 00:20:47,179
a commission on the second level for

417
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:52,650
give it an unleashed and that all

418
00:20:47,179 --> 00:20:56,100
We can create that good basic

419
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:59,010
I went to see how I did to

420
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:02,190
disseminating that thought and this

421
00:20:59,010 --> 00:21:05,460
project this project that forced me to

422
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:07,890
create a corporation because I saw that this

423
00:21:05,460 --> 00:21:10,230
can generate not only silver for everyone

424
00:21:07,890 --> 00:21:12,840
but for a corporation then I created

425
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:17,130
A non -profit corporation to

426
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:19,980
that to which then theoretically goes

427
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:22,920
to enter many resources if you

428
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:25,140
They agree that in

429
00:21:22,920 --> 00:21:27,810
include this project

430
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:31,380
Then everyone will generate an income

431
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:33,420
And along with the corporation too

432
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:35,100
We are going to pay the government and we are going

433
00:21:33,420 --> 00:21:39,500
to pay the banks because we use

434
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:39,500
We use banks use

435
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:44,860
All these media we also use

436
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:46,740
The means of payment at the level

437
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:49,800
international

438
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,080
It is a wins this is yes that is a

439
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:54,900
real channel because we are going to win

440
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,580
All the corporation will be without encouragement

441
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:58,890
for profit because it makes no sense to say

442
00:21:56,580 --> 00:22:01,290
that someone certainly and that money of

443
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:06,470
That money that wins the corporation is

444
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:08,910
to reinvest it and social things auto

445
00:22:06,470 --> 00:22:10,590
sustainable we are not friends with

446
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:14,730
free economies than

447
00:22:10,590 --> 00:22:18,360
Free economies do not win do not

448
00:22:14,730 --> 00:22:20,580
generate do not generate evolution if they are

449
00:22:18,360 --> 00:22:22,980
With free economies they stagnate

450
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:24,840
And they collapse because they do not generate

451
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:27,090
incentives for people to produce the

452
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:28,909
incentive that is very important in the

453
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:32,359
human being

454
00:22:28,909 --> 00:22:35,450
And it is very human and it is not a sin

455
00:22:32,359 --> 00:22:40,260
we can all have so this

456
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:44,559
Project aims to intend that

457
00:22:40,260 --> 00:22:47,799
And achieve that I hope

458
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:50,529
that interests really tell you

459
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:52,300
this genesis because I think it is

460
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:56,370
interesting

461
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:59,200
I keep believing and I still founded that

462
00:22:56,370 --> 00:23:01,720
When we all know a little about the

463
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:04,480
economic theory or my invitation is

464
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:06,970
to see not only the income that

465
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,390
They may generally have a basic income and

466
00:23:06,970 --> 00:23:13,060
Then we improve it but understand

467
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:15,160
that if we understand the economy is not going to

468
00:23:13,060 --> 00:23:18,640
be so easy for us to do everything

469
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:22,150
They make us in the jeans the bankers

470
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:24,040
They take over from everything with the management of

471
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:29,340
the monetary mass and the interest rate

472
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:29,340
They take over all then

473
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:36,130
So that is the project that is what

474
00:23:34,010 --> 00:23:36,130
that

475
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:40,309
What we want

476
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:44,310
What we want what we intend to do

477
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:47,490
With this project

478
00:23:44,310 --> 00:23:52,140
With your help the project is

479
00:23:47,490 --> 00:23:55,500
social belongs to everyone and we all do it and

480
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:58,640
I hope it is something that really

481
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,640
They unite us because

482
00:23:58,730 --> 00:24:05,510
condition is always like me alone and

483
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:08,919
the others that not the others that also

484
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:13,100
We benefited this time we think differently

485
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:15,020
We then invite you to understand

486
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:18,590
better projects see the following

487
00:24:15,020 --> 00:24:20,860
videos and include and encourage

488
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:22,929
buy

489
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:26,950
Energy Corporation Products

490
00:24:22,929 --> 00:24:31,170
economic that we will grow them

491
00:24:26,950 --> 00:24:31,170
assume teeth in your time

492
00:24:31,559 --> 00:24:37,220
and that we have a different flight of

493
00:24:35,249 --> 00:24:41,159
Here

494
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:44,820
friendly that we can live in peace than

495
00:24:41,159 --> 00:24:47,389
We can generate good things for

496
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:47,389
Our society

497
00:24:48,390 --> 00:24:50,930
I got married
