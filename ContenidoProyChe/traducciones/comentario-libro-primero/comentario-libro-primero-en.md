# CLAUDE.AI COMMENTARY ON THE FIRST BOOK ECONOMIC THEORY

## "Economic Theory: A heterodox proposal for Colombia (1997)"

### A pioneering text that questioned monetary dogmas during economic opening

The essay "Economic Theory" by Mauricio Rivadeneira Mora, written in 1997, represents a valuable contribution to Colombian heterodox economic thought at a crucial historical moment: the implementation of economic opening policies under a regime of high interest rates.

In this work, Rivadeneira frontally challenges the dominant monetary orthodoxy, arguing that the high interest rates imposed by the Bank of the Republic not only did not control inflation, but were its main cause, also generating severe damage to national productive capacity.

The work anticipates several of the economic problems that Colombia would face in the following years and proposes a theoretical framework that integrates and expands Keynesian elements to address the relationship between interest rates, investment, savings and inflation from a systemic perspective.

Among its most significant contributions is the analysis of "inflation due to interest rate effects," a phenomenon little studied in conventional economic literature but which the author develops clearly, showing how high rates generate a combined effect of cost-push and demand-pull inflation that makes monetary supply control useless.

More than two decades after its publication, this document remains relevant both for its historical value and for the validity of many of its approaches in economies that continue to debate central bank autonomy, interest rate management and the effects of monetary policy in contexts of commercial opening.

The Economic Heresy Corporation rescues this valuable contribution to alternative economic thought, which invites us to rethink the foundations of our monetary policies and their impact on productive development.

## COMPLEMENTARY ELEMENTS FOR "ECONOMIC THEORY" (1997)

### 1. ABOUT THIS WORK (Editorial Note)

"Economic Theory: How to Control Interest Rates, Monetary Supply, Inflation, Expectations and Uncertainty in the Economy (A Proposal for Colombia)" was written by Mauricio Rivadeneira Mora in 1997, amid profound economic transformations in Colombia.

This digital edition preserves the original text entirely, respecting its content as a historical document of Colombian economic thought. The only changes made correspond to formatting and presentation aspects, intended to improve the reading experience in digital media.

The Economic Heresy Corporation rescues this work as part of its mission to recover and disseminate heterodox perspectives in economics that have challenged conventional thinking and offer alternatives to understand and address contemporary economic problems.

### 2. HISTORICAL CONTEXT

#### Colombia's economic moment (1990-1997)

At the beginning of the 90s, Colombia experienced a process of economic opening under the government of César Gaviria (1990-1994), which profoundly transformed the protectionist structure that had characterized the Colombian economy. This process included:

- Drastic reduction of tariffs (from an average of 44% to 12%)
- Financial liberalization
- New Constitution of 1991 that enshrined the independence of the Bank of the Republic
- Privatization of state enterprises

During the presidency of Ernesto Samper (1994-1998), the period when this book was written, Colombia simultaneously faced:

- Political crisis due to Process 8000 scandals
- Persistent inflation between 18% and 21%
- Interest rates that exceeded 40% in effective annual terms
- Growing fiscal deficit
- First signs of the recession that would break out in 1999

Rivadeneira Mora's text emerges precisely as a critical reaction to the monetary management of the Bank of the Republic, which privileged inflation control through high interest rates, a policy that the author considered counterproductive and causative of the approaching crisis.

#### The landscape of economic thought

Globally, the 1990s represented the apogee of the so-called "Washington Consensus," characterized by policies of economic liberalization, privatization and fiscal and monetary discipline. International financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank actively promoted these policies in Latin America.

In this context, Rivadeneira Mora's text constitutes a dissident voice that:

1. Questions the predominant monetary orthodoxy
2. Retakes elements of Keynesian thought when neoliberalism was at its peak
3. Anticipates problems that would later be recognized even by conventional economists

### 3. ANALYSIS OF MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS

#### Critique of institutional separation of fiscal and monetary policies

At the time, Rivadeneira's critique of the separation between the management of real (government) and monetary (Bank of the Republic) variables was considered heterodox. Today, after crises like 2008 and the pandemic, there is growing recognition of the need for greater coordination between these policies.

The author accurately notes: "It is impossible for the ship in which each one goes their own way to reach safe harbor. It is not appropriate for academia to move on one side and executors on another. Theory and practice must go in unison, one feeding the other."

#### Interest rate as structural limit to development

Perhaps the most original contribution of the text is its analysis of how high interest rates function as a "containment wall" that structurally limits productive development possibilities. The author demonstrates how this occurs through several mechanisms:

1. Direct limitation of the marginal efficiency of capital
2. Generation of financial costs that reduce international competitiveness
3. Creation of an inflationary environment that feeds back on itself
4. Attraction of speculative capital that distorts the exchange rate

This vision anticipates contemporary debates about the limits that orthodox monetary policies impose on productive development in emerging economies.

#### Reinterpretation of the savings-investment relationship

The author retakes and expands the Keynesian approach to the relationship between interest rates, savings and investment, arguing that a high interest rate reduces both consumption and aggregate savings, contrary to conventional intuition.

Rivadeneira writes: "This conclusion is of such transcendence that there is no economics textbook, however elementary, that does not warn about this paradox, or as economists frequently say, about this fallacy."

What is remarkable is how the author applies this principle to the specific situation of a developing economy with high nominal rates, showing its perverse effects in a context of commercial opening.

#### The economic policy proposal

The central proposal of the book—reducing the deposit rate to 3% and limiting banking intermediation to 7%—was radical for its time. However, some successful emerging economies have followed similar paths of internationally competitive interest rates as the basis for their productive development.

The author proposes a three-stage plan to implement this reduction, recognizing the transition challenges, but arguing that the cost of not doing so would be greater—a prediction that would be confirmed with the Colombian economic crisis of 1999.

### 4. CONTEMPORARY VALIDITY AND PROJECTIONS

#### Current debates on monetary policy

Recent discussions about the limits of conventional monetary policy, particularly after the 2008 crisis and during the pandemic, have revitalized many of the heterodox approaches found in this book:

- Recognition that monetary policy has important distributive effects
- The need to consider multiple objectives, not just inflation control
- Questioning the neutrality of money in the long term
- The importance of expectations and psychological factors in markets

#### Application to contemporary emerging contexts

Rivadeneira's analysis is particularly relevant for emerging economies that today face dilemmas similar to those of Colombia in the 90s:

- Countries seeking to industrialize while maintaining competitive exchange rates
- Economies experiencing persistent inflation with high interest rates
- Nations with financial systems showing high intermediation margins

#### New perspectives in development economics

Rivadeneira's work connects with contemporary approaches that recognize the importance of internal financial conditions for development:

- Modern Latin American structuralist economics
- Political economy approaches on the role of the financial system
- Debates on fiscal and monetary spaces in developing countries

### 5. BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE

Mauricio Rivadeneira Mora (Bogotá, 1953) initially trained in Physics at the National University of Colombia before graduating as an Economist from the University of La Salle. His dual training in exact sciences and economics provided him with a unique perspective reflected in his economic analysis, where he frequently establishes analogies with principles of physical sciences.

He has been a professor in courses on mathematics, physics, econometrics, budgets and macroeconomics at various institutions, including the Cooperative University of Colombia. As a professional, he has served as a business advisor in project development and diagnostics, providing services to different consulting firms.

His interest in the construction and structure of scientific theories, and their correlation with practice, has allowed him to develop an original approach to economic analysis, as evidenced in "Economic Theory" (1997) and other subsequent writings.

## Conclusion

These complementary elements could be presented as separate sections that accompany the original text, whether in digital or printed format, offering valuable context for contemporary readers without altering the historical content of the document.
