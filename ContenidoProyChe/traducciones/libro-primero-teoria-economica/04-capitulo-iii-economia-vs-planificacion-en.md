# CHAPTER III

**ECONOMY -vs- PLANNING**

**Santa Fe de Bogot√°, August 1996**

In the previous chapters we have demonstrated how inadequate management of interest rates can produce devastating effects on the economy. In this chapter we will analyze an even more fundamental problem: the tension between allowing the economy to function freely and the temptation to centrally plan economic variables.

## The Fundamental Dilemma

One of the most complex problems faced by economic policymakers is determining when to intervene in markets and when to allow market forces to operate freely. This dilemma becomes particularly acute when dealing with the management of monetary variables such as interest rates, exchange rates and money supply.

The Colombian experience of the 90s perfectly illustrates this dilemma. On one hand, an economic opening policy was adopted that supposedly should allow market forces to determine resource allocation. On the other hand, strict control of monetary variables was maintained, particularly interest rates, which contradicted free market principles.

## The Limits of Central Planning

The economic history of the 20th century has taught us the limitations of central planning. Socialist experiments in the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe and other countries demonstrated that it is impossible for a central planner to possess all the information necessary to make efficient economic decisions.

However, the lesson should not be that all government intervention is bad, but that we must be very careful about which variables we decide to control centrally and which we should let the market determine.

## The Role of Prices as Signals

In a market economy, prices fulfill a crucial informational function. They act as signals that coordinate the decisions of millions of economic agents. When prices are free to move according to supply and demand forces, they transmit information about relative scarcity, consumer preferences and profit opportunities.

Interest rates are perhaps the most important price in a modern economy. They are the price of money over time, and therefore influence all decisions that involve a temporal element: investment, saving, present versus future consumption, etc.

When the government artificially fixes interest rates at levels that do not reflect market conditions, it is distorting the most important signal in the economic system.

## The Information Problem

One of the most powerful arguments in favor of the free market is the information problem. No central planner, however intelligent and well-intentioned, can possess all the information required to make efficient economic decisions.

This information includes:

### 1. Consumer Preferences
The tastes and preferences of millions of consumers change constantly and unpredictably. Only the price system can aggregate this information efficiently.

### 2. Technological Conditions
Technological possibilities change continuously. New production methods, new products, new materials appear constantly. Entrepreneurs in the field are best able to evaluate these opportunities.

### 3. Local Conditions
The specific conditions of each market, each region, each industry are better known by agents who operate directly in them.

### 4. Tacit Information
There is a type of knowledge that cannot be easily codified or transmitted. It is practical knowledge, experience, entrepreneurial intuition. This type of knowledge can only be used by those who possess it directly.

## The Case of Interest Rates in Colombia

Colombian monetary policy of the 90s perfectly illustrates the problems of central planning in the monetary sphere. The Monetary Board decided to fix interest rates at levels it considered appropriate to control inflation, without taking into account the signals the market was sending.

### Market Signals

During 1995 and 1996, the market sent multiple signals that interest rates were too high:

1. **Excess Liquidity**: Banks had excess liquidity, indicating there was more supply of funds than demand at those rates.

2. **Credit Contraction**: Credit contracted drastically, indicating that companies could not pay those rates for productive projects.

3. **Recession**: The economy entered recession, indicating that monetary conditions were too restrictive.

4. **Investment Fall**: Private investment collapsed, confirming that rates were choking productive activity.

### The Planners' Response

Despite these clear market signals, the Monetary Board persisted in maintaining high rates, arguing it was necessary to control inflation. This response illustrates one of the fundamental problems of central planning: the tendency to ignore market signals when they contradict planners' theories or models.

## The Illusion of Control

One of the most serious problems of central planning is what we could call "the illusion of control." Planners tend to overestimate their ability to control complex economic variables.

In the case of monetary policy, there is the illusion that by controlling one or two variables (such as interest rates or money supply), one can control the behavior of the entire economy. This illusion ignores the complexity of economic interactions and the ability of economic agents to adapt and find ways to evade controls.

### Examples of Unintended Effects

The high interest rate policy in Colombia produced multiple unintended effects that planners did not anticipate:

1. **Capital Flight to Financial Sector**: Instead of stimulating productive saving, high rates simply transferred resources from the real sector to the financial sector.

2. **Exchange Appreciation**: High rates attracted speculative capital that appreciated the peso, harming exports.

3. **Increase in Non-Performing Loans**: High rates led many companies to bankruptcy, increasing banks' non-performing loans.

4. **Reduction of Tax Base**: The recession reduced government income, worsening the fiscal deficit that was supposedly being controlled.

## Principles for Efficient Economic Policy

Based on Colombian experience and economic theory, we can derive some principles for more efficient economic policy:

### 1. Minimize Price Distortions

Government should avoid administratively fixing prices, especially prices as important as interest rates. Instead, it should concentrate on creating conditions for markets to function efficiently.

### 2. Use Quantitative, Not Price Variables

If government needs to influence the economy, it is preferable to use quantitative variables (such as money supply) rather than price variables (such as interest rates). This allows prices to maintain their informational function.

### 3. Gradualism and Predictability

When policy changes are necessary, they should be gradual and predictable. Abrupt changes create uncertainty and can have destabilizing effects.

### 4. Policy Coordination

Different government policies must be coordinated. It makes no sense to have a trade opening policy while maintaining a restrictive monetary policy that appreciates the currency.

### 5. Monitoring Market Signals

Policymakers should constantly monitor signals sent by the market and be willing to adjust their policies when these signals indicate something is wrong.

## The Appropriate Role of Government

This does not mean government has no role to play in the economy. On the contrary, there are areas where government intervention is necessary and beneficial:

### 1. Provision of Public Goods

Government should provide goods that the market cannot efficiently provide: infrastructure, education, public health, defense, etc.

### 2. Regulation of Natural Monopolies

In sectors where natural monopolies exist, government should regulate to avoid abuses of market power.

### 3. Correction of Externalities

When significant externalities exist, government can intervene to internalize them.

### 4. Macroeconomic Stabilization

Government has a role in macroeconomic stabilization, but should do so in a way that respects market functioning.

## Lessons from International Experience

The experience of other countries confirms these lessons:

### Successful Cases

**Chile**: After the 80s crisis, Chile adopted policies that respected market signals while maintaining fiscal and monetary discipline.

**New Zealand**: Adopted an inflation targeting system that allowed flexibility in short-term interest rates.

**Australia**: Combined financial liberalization with prudent macroeconomic policies.

### Failed Cases

**Argentina**: Price and exchange rate controls led to recurrent crises.

**Brazil**: Multiple stabilization plans that ignored market signals failed repeatedly until the Real Plan.

## The Problem of Time Inconsistency

One of the most serious problems faced by central planners is time inconsistency. Policies that seem optimal in the short term may be suboptimal in the long term.

In the Colombian case, maintaining high rates might seem appropriate to control inflation in the short term, but in the long term it was destroying the economy's productive capacity.

## The Importance of Institutions

For a market economy to function efficiently, solid institutions are required:

### 1. Clear Property Rights

Economic agents must have security about their property rights.

### 2. Efficient Legal System

There must be a legal system that enforces contracts and resolves disputes efficiently.

### 3. Solid Financial Institutions

The financial system must be solid and well regulated.

### 4. Transparency and Accountability

Public institutions must be transparent and subject to accountability.

## Chapter Conclusions

The Colombian experience of the 90s illustrates the dangers of central planning in the monetary sphere. The main points are:

1. **Prices, including interest rates, fulfill a crucial informational function** that should not be distorted by administrative interventions.

2. **No central planner can possess all the information necessary** to make efficient economic decisions.

3. **The market sends constant signals** that policymakers must learn to read and respect.

4. **The illusion of control leads to counterproductive policies** that ignore the complexity of economic interactions.

5. **Government has an important role in the economy**, but must exercise it in a way that respects market functioning.

6. **Solid institutions are fundamental** for a market economy to function efficiently.

The fundamental lesson is that **the economy is too complex to be centrally planned**, but this does not mean it should lack direction. The key lies in finding the correct balance between allowing markets to function and providing the institutional framework necessary for them to function efficiently.

The path to a prosperous economy does not pass through more central planning, but through better institutions and greater respect for market signals.
