## ECONOMIC THEOREM

**By Mauricio Rivadeneira Mora**

If a country does not perform primary issuance to supply the system with the new monetary resources that the country requires, this system will have no equilibrium point, the monetary mass will tend to disappear, commerce will involute towards a primitive stage of barter, and modern society will not be able to subsist.

### Demonstration

As a first measure it is necessary to understand that paper money is not produced by work, nor by gold, nor by any other element. Money, in its modern conception, as paper money, has its origin in the printing press. This is how the dollar is born, and any other currency in the world. Then to say that the dollar is a finer paper than the ruble or the yen or the Colombian peso is nonsense, as is also affirming that only the USA can directly produce its dollar while the rest of the world can only do it with dollar backing.

Now, why is paper money necessary? Simple. A society could produce many things, that is, work much and very hard. But if paper money does not exist, it is not possible to produce exchange, not in a civilization as populous as ours, although it was possible in an earlier stage.

Now we must demonstrate why this amount of money must grow continuously. Which is also elementary if we think that as population increases, the capacity to produce increasingly greater quantities of articles also increases, and this greater quantity of articles will necessarily require greater quantity of money in circulation. It is not possible to think that today in Colombia we could maintain commerce with the same amount of money in circulation that we had ten years ago.

Now, we know that the printing press that each issuing bank manages produces paper money when:

1. It receives dollars or other currencies of market acceptance, or
2. When it receives gold, or
3. When it makes free or primary issuance, as it has been called.

The condition for the system to be balanced is that to satisfy internal needs the country performs primary money issuance, regardless of how high the interest rate is. But the higher the interest rate, the greater the issuance will have to be.

But if the country does not perform its primary issuance it will have no possibilities in the long term for the following reason:

1. The tendency of exports and imports in the long term is to remain balanced. That is, if the value of currencies is allowed to fluctuate freely, in one period exports will be greater than imports, and in the following period the relationship will be inverted. Then the net effect of imports and exports will be neutrality, and there will be no surplus currencies, so that the country can generate its internal paper money that it needs.

2. With external credits. It is supposed that some currencies enter which when monetized will produce the paper money required. This will work in the short term, but the balance that must exist between imports and exports will be broken, since the excess of currencies will make importing more attractive, much cheaper, which will cause strange competition to native industry.

Furthermore, the moment will come when that credit must be paid, plus interest, which will cause the issuing Bank to collect pesos from the market, decreasing its monetary base. And since what is required is that the monetary base increase each time, then an even much larger credit will be required, and so on. Until absolute illiquidity is reached, and no one lends again, that is, when the few dollars held in reserve acquire such a high value that they could well take all the circulating money. And when money is withdrawn from circulation, commerce disappears. Then industries lose all possibility since money cannot be obtained anywhere, and finally banking runs out of money, which irremediably means the bankruptcy of the entire system. There is simply no possibility of equilibrium, since by not making its primary issuance, nothing can prevent money from disappearing. One could think of selling all assets like companies and houses and everything, which would momentarily alleviate the problem, but fundamentally only aggravates it, since the cycle starts again. We have completed the demonstration.

Such a profound error as not making primary issuance will cost humanity a very high price. Let us make clear that the advantage of primary issuance over external credits is that they have the same effect inside the country, which is to increase the monetary base, with the difference that while one costs us nothing more than doing work, the other leaves us with debt.

It is essential that for "the invisible hand" to act and for the economy to expand, there must be primary money issuance.
