# CHAPTER IV

**A COMPARATIVE DEMONSTRATIVE MODEL**

## (COST INFLATION, MONETARY EFFECT, AND VIA INTEREST RATES)

**Santa Fe de Bogotá, November 1996**

In the previous chapters we have analyzed the conceptual and practical problems of Colombian economic policy. In this chapter we will develop a comparative model that allows us to rigorously demonstrate the different mechanisms through which inflation can be generated, and how adopted policies can have counterproductive effects.

## Model Introduction

To better understand inflationary mechanisms and their interrelations, it is useful to develop a formal model that captures the essential aspects of the functioning of a modern economy. This model will allow us to compare the effects of different types of policies and demonstrate why certain interventions can be counterproductive.

## DEMAND INFLATION

Demand inflation occurs when aggregate demand exceeds the productive capacity of the economy. In our model:

**Basic Condition:**
### Demand Components

Aggregate demand includes:
- Private consumption (C)
- Private investment (I)
- Public spending (G)
- Net exports (X-M)

### Transmission Mechanism

When AD > Y_full_employment:
1. Shortage of goods and services
2. Upward pressure on prices
3. Generalized inflation

### Appropriate Policies

To combat demand inflation:
- Contractionary fiscal policy (reduce G, increase T)
- Restrictive monetary policy (moderately increase rates)
- Supply policies (increase productivity)

## COST INFLATION

Cost inflation originates when production costs increase, forcing companies to raise prices.

### Main Sources

1. **Wage Increases** above productivity increments
2. **Raw Material Increases** (energy, imported inputs)
3. **High Financial Costs** (high interest rates)
4. **Devaluation** that makes imported inputs more expensive

### Cost Function

Total costs include:
### Price Setting

Companies set prices by applying a margin over costs:
### The Problem of Restrictive Monetary Policies

When inflation is cost-driven, increasing interest rates is counterproductive because:

1. **Increases Financial Costs**: Companies pay more for financing
2. **Raises Production Costs**: Financial costs are part of total costs
3. **Feeds More Inflation**: Higher costs → higher prices

## INFLATION BY INTEREST RATE EFFECTS

This is a specific case of cost inflation, particularly relevant for Colombia.

### Direct Mechanism

When interest rates are very high:
1. Companies' financial costs increase
2. These costs are transferred to prices
3. Cost inflation is generated

### Indirect Mechanism

High rates also generate inflation indirectly:
1. **Reduce Investment**: Lower productivity → higher unit costs
2. **Contract Supply**: Less efficient companies exit → less competition
3. **Generate Expectations**: Restrictive policy signals

### The Paradox

Trying to control inflation with high rates can:
### Numerical Example

If a company has:
- Sales: $1,000 million
- Debt: $300 million
- Interest rate: 35% annual

Financial costs = $300M × 35% = $105 million

If the rate drops to 15%:
Financial costs = $300M × 15% = $45 million
Savings = $60 million that can be transferred to lower prices

## COMMENTS ON SAVING-INVESTMENT

### The Fundamental Identity

In any economy it holds:
### Effects of High Rates

When interest rates rise significantly:

1. **Investment Falls**: Projects become unprofitable
2. **Saving Must Fall**: Due to accounting identity
3. **Mechanism**: Lower investment → lower income → lower saving capacity

### The Savings Paradox

The attempt to increase saving through high rates results in:
Exactly the opposite of the intended objective.

### Colombian Empirical Evidence

During 1995-1997:
- Deposit rates: 25-35%
- Private investment: Fell drastically
- National saving: Decreased
- GDP: Grew below potential

## EXPECTATIONS AND UNCERTAINTY

### Expectation Formation

Agents form inflationary expectations based on:
1. **Past Experience**: Recent inflation
2. **Announced Policies**: Credibility of authorities
3. **Market Signals**: Behavior of key prices

### Effects of Inconsistent Policies

Contradictory policies generate:
1. **Greater Uncertainty**: Agents don't know what to expect
2. **Volatile Expectations**: Frequent changes in projections
3. **Defensive Behaviors**: Indexation, dollarization

### Importance of Credibility

For an anti-inflationary policy to work:
1. **Must be Consistent**: Not constantly changing
2. **Must be Credible**: Agents must trust it will be maintained
3. **Must be Coherent**: Different instruments must point in the same direction

## NECESSARY AND SUFFICIENT CONDITIONS

### For Price Stability

**Necessary Conditions:**
1. Balance between aggregate supply and demand
2. Stable production costs
3. Anchored inflationary expectations
4. Moderate interest rates (compatible with productivity)

**Sufficient Conditions:**
In addition to the above:
5. Solid and credible institutions
6. Coordination of economic policies
7. Market flexibility

### For Growth with Stability

Sustainable growth requires:
1. **Adequate Investment**: Interest rates that allow profitable projects
2. **Macroeconomic Stability**: Predictable prices and policies
3. **Productive Efficiency**: Competitive markets
4. **Solid Institutions**: Appropriate regulatory framework

### Application to the Colombian Case

In Colombia 1995-1997 several conditions were violated:
1. **Excessive Rates**: Well above capital productivity
2. **Inconsistent Policies**: Opening + monetary restriction
3. **Unstable Expectations**: High volatility

## Model Conclusions

### Diagnosis of Inflation Type

It is crucial to correctly identify the type of inflation:
- **Demand**: Requires moderate restrictive policies
- **Cost**: Does not respond to restrictive monetary policies
- **Interest Rate**: Worsens with restrictive policies

### Appropriate Policies

**For Demand Inflation:**
- Prudent fiscal policy
- Moderately restrictive monetary policy
- Productivity promotion

**For Cost Inflation:**
- Identify and attack specific cost sources
- Avoid very restrictive monetary policies
- Improve competitiveness and productivity

**For Interest Rate Inflation:**
- Gradually reduce interest rates
- Anchor expectations with credible policy
- Coordinate with fiscal policy

### General Lessons

1. **Diagnosis is Crucial**: Wrong policy can worsen the problem
2. **Expectations Matter**: Credibility is essential
3. **Policy Coordination**: Instruments must work in the same direction
4. **Gradualism**: Abrupt changes generate instability
5. **Solid Institutions**: Predictable framework is fundamental

### Practical Application

For Colombia in 1996-1997, the model suggests:
1. **Gradually Reduce Interest Rates**
2. **Maintain Fiscal Discipline**
3. **Anchor Expectations** with credible program
4. **Coordinate** monetary and commercial policy
5. **Strengthen Institutions** to give credibility

This formal model provides the rigorous theoretical framework that justifies the policy recommendations developed in the following chapters.
