# CHAPTER I

**ECONOMIC SCIENCE**

## AND ITS CURRENT APPLICATION IN COLOMBIA

**Santa Fe de Bogot√°, August 1996**

It is the function of the agents responsible for economic organization of a country to oversee the proper management of variables that intervene and regulate markets in order to achieve stable growth without trauma, minimizing the economic cycles inherent to capitalism. For this they rely on the advancement and knowledge acquired by economic science and the different experiences of countries, it being a double sin to forget both theory and practice, and even to apply knowledge mechanically or orthodoxly.

## Keynes' Macroeconomic System

Since the time of Keynes we can say that economics was structured as a system, bequeathing a macroeconomic model composed of five basic equations:

Two real equations of demand and supply of goods and services:

(1) income Y = C + S (consumption plus saving),

(2) and production Y = C + I (consumption plus investment),

Two monetary equations of money supply and demand:

(3) M = M1 + M2,

(4) L = L1 + L2;

and a fifth equation that links the real equations or functions with the monetary ones,

(5) Y/M = V, or velocity of money circulation.

Despite having this system of equations we cannot say that things function as in the physical sciences, where with a system of fundamental equations stated as principles or laws one can deduce all the consequences that derive from them, allowing us to build buildings, cars, airplanes, explain the functioning of the universe and predict future consequences given initial conditions. No. In economics it is different, although it is possible to make qualitative predictions with a certain margin of reliability.

## Evolution of Economic Thought

Since the beginnings of formal economics, the theorists of the science including Keynes have dedicated themselves to finding the way in which the different variables of the system relate, and their dependence on the interest rate, employment, price level, economic cycles, propensity to consume and save, etc., seeking to determine which are the dependent variables and which are the independent ones.

Subsequently with national accounting methods, variable measurement and the development of econometric methods, simulation models could be developed that allowed better planning of a country's governance work. It should be noted that these models are not as exact as one would like, nor are they irrefutable, and they depend on the initial premises that one introduces into them. For this reason, if these premises are not adequate, the results of their application can become catastrophic for an economy. I think such is the current situation of the Colombian case, which I propose to show in this discourse.

## Monetary Issuance and Its Effects

Over time economists realized they could issue money without gold backing, and many shouted Eureka. Governments began to finance themselves with this resource, believing they could thus incentivize demand and invite producers to offer more, that is, increase supply and therefore employment. This policy was supported by CEPAL and generally applied in South America. The well-known result was permanent and quite high inflation, oscillating between 25% and 35% in those countries that applied it with relative moderation.

Before we accused the government of inflation when it spent too much. Today, in Colombia, for the same expenditure we accuse it not of inflation but of high interest rates.

## The Real Nature of Monetary Variables

Let us clarify an aspect first. Although in economic theory, by convention, we have mentioned two real equations and two monetary ones, this does not mean that the monetary ones are fictitious. On the contrary, they are very real, and really influence the economy according to their management. Thus, when permanent issuance by the issuing bank occurred to finance public expenditure, the effect was inflationary and will continue to be so as long as there is no increase in the product. In this way, with the management of a monetary variable a real and tangible effect for the population has been achieved, which is inflation; and when inflation arrives by this route, it is clearly an indirect tax that the government charges us, and equally, to all taxpayers.

But this effect does not influence the real interest rate. It is as if in some mysterious way the system realized the deception and the rate perceived it, maintaining itself above inflation.

## Normal Levels of Interest Rates

Normally, when there is no inflation, the interest rate paid to individuals who deposit their resources in banks can oscillate between 3% and 5% annually, and in turn, banks charge those who request loans more or less 4 to 6 additional points. That is, in an economy without inflation the lending interest rate can oscillate between 7% and 11% annually.

When there is inflation the real, institutional interest rate rises some points, plus the effect of inflation. Thus, if inflation is 20%, the agent who supplies money for an investment will be recognized a maximum of 5 to 6 points, so the deposit rate would be in the order of 26%; and the agent who requests the loan will generally be charged 8 more points, so the normal lending rate for an economy with 20% inflation would oscillate around 34%, but in real terms, it will not exceed 12 or 14%, due to banking intermediation.

In short, we can affirm that the real economy does not let itself be "deceived" by monetary tricks. In fact the economy can continue growing even with inflation, but with a real interest rate that does not, in general, exceed the aforementioned limits.

## Colombia's Problem

We then ask ourselves, why is Colombia charging a rate of almost 40%, about 6 points above normal? Why does banking charge up to 11 and 12 points for its intermediation? Does this perhaps obey poor management by the government or the issuing bank? What hidden interests are being managed and by whom? Does the government's political crisis perhaps influence this?

## Development of Monetarist Thought

When economists realized that economic control could be done through monetary equations, they were erroneously called monetarists in opposition to Keynesians. In reality Keynes bequeathed the entire system, although naturally, he did not deduce all possibilities. In reality economic theory was developing. Today we should not call ourselves classical, neoclassical, liberal, neoliberal, etc. We all continue being Keynesians, developing his system of equations in a similar way to how the physical sciences do.

In modern times economists have realized that the best indicator of different variables are prices. These react when there is an unsatisfied need, or when a good is exhausted or there is excess. They also observed that when subsidies are given, services become poor quality. Freedom of prices began to gain ground again as in the origins of capitalism, except that today we have more knowledge of the system's variables, and the situation can be better controlled. Economic science has slowly been gaining ground in mastering reality. However this is so changeable that it is still quite an art to be able to diagnose and supply the correct drug.

## Colombia's Constitutional Error

Indeed, the first to make an error was the constitution, when it separated the management of real variables under the government and monetary variables in the hands of the Bank of the Republic, as if the system, which is unique, and which must function as a harmonious whole, could be separated by giving responsibility only to the government but leaving the helm in the hands of the issuing bank. In synthesis, it is impossible for a ship where each goes their own way to reach safe harbor. It is not adequate for academia to move on one side and executors on another. Theory and practice must go in unison, one feeding the other. In this same dimension, the constitution should have been more general, and not limit the Issuer to the sole task of controlling inflation, the exchange rate, and monetary supply, when in economics one must speak of global equilibrium, development, growth, employment indices, etc., and not to mention principles.

## Free Trade Principles

Indeed, since the time of David Ricardo we have been told that with free trade all nations benefit together, and only now do we begin to understand this principle, which for some time now the developed countries have been promoting although they do not always want to apply it themselves, that is, in the North American style, but which Colombia assumed from the previous administration by accepting opening, and since it no longer has reverse, it is better that we prepare to assume the challenge as a total set.

To illustrate this about principles, let us say that the issuing bank together with the government should rather control that all agents of the economy have the same rights and conditions to compete in a free market, avoiding preferences and monopolies so that whoever leaves the market is due to inefficiency or non-competitiveness, and not due to an arbitrary measure that places entrepreneurs in insurmountable difficulties, as has indeed happened when manipulating the real interest rate, since this does not currently obey a free market of supply and demand, easily demonstrable by the fact that banking is flooded with liquidity without this motivating the rate a few points down, as it should be under normal conditions, and also by the fact of finding itself well above that of international banking, which will not hesitate a moment to take whatever slice it can, all this in supposed opening conditions.

## Impact on Companies

In contrast, companies do feel its effect since they cannot react with the price of their goods, as they have to compete with a much cheaper foreign supply due to revaluation, and with restricted demand because families have to allocate more of their income to cover interest. Indeed, a very high interest rate decreases consumption, but let us not forget that companies live off that consumption, and cutting it off is like cutting off oxygen to a diver. The sequence is simple:

### Sequence of Business Crisis

With opening alone, companies are forced to lower prices due to competition, which implies that profitability begins to decrease. This process is not so fast, and gives them time to improve their processes or disappear; but this means they were replaced by more efficient ones, and there is no trauma in the economy.

When additionally an abrupt change in the interest rate occurs, and sales suddenly collapse, there is no such replacement of some companies by others, all decrease their activity. And their variable expenses, which require time to be able to react, begin to become fixed, income is not enough to cover fixed and variable costs, and purchases have to be stopped. Payments to suppliers become difficult, and even payments to the government. Initially inventories accumulate and increase, but soon it is the only thing that can be realized, working capital investments begin to disappear. Financial obligations are breached, and concordat processes come and then liquidations with massive unemployment. Properties in plants and equipment remain in the power of banks, unused, there is disinvestment. Negative investment. It means that savings decrease precipitously.

## The Danger of Manipulating Real Variables

When real variables of the economy are touched in such a way that they do not obey the free market of supply and demand, it is something like opening the door to misfortunes. As proof, it suffices to glance at the drug market, whose prohibition far from motivating a decrease in consumption only manages to incentivize prices upward, increase consumption and therefore production, with all its sequels of crimes, battles and diseases.

## Analysis of the Issuing Bank's Motivations

We still need to analyze the motives that induced the issuing bank to take the measure of modifying the interest rate. Whether this corresponds to reality, and whether its consequences are coherent or contradict the objective they intend.

The first symptom that the Bank of the Republic board noticed was the percentage increase in credits held by banking, with indices higher than supposedly expected in the model used by the issuer.

Let us not forget that Keynes' first equation tells us that from total income families allocate their resources to consumption expenses, and their surplus, they save.

Therefore, following the issuer, if consumption has increased percentually, it is because savings have decreased, also percentually. This has all the logic in the world.

## Questioning the Diagnosis

But let us question. Did the issuer deduce the percentage increase in savings, or its low level, only from the fact of the percentage increase in the portfolio held by banking? Did the issuer perhaps have the opportunity to effectively measure GDP in two immediate periods, to be able to determine how consumption had moved, and how savings?

If so, reason may accompany it. But let us continue questioning. Is that GDP well measured? I mean, does it include income from the informal economy? Let us not forget that the real economy does not let itself be "deceived," and the fact that a sector does not pay taxes does not mean it is not there, generating employment and wealth. Although in general we can despise the informal economy for not being significant, we cannot say the same when it comes to drug trafficking, whose resources can be highly representative within GDP.

## Keynes' Dual Equation

But if this income measurement presents insurmountable technical difficulties, we can still observe the problem from Keynes' other equation because it intrinsically contains double-entry bookkeeping. This equation tells us that production agents are manufacturing consumer goods and investment goods, and since these agents are the ones who compensate families, it is inferred that production equals income, therefore by deduction savings equal investment. Although this equation would present the same difficulty as the previous one for its measurement, it will allow us to take a look at the complement of savings, investment.

That is, to affirm that the savings level is very low is equivalent to saying that investment is very low. Would the Bank Board review this assumption before taking any measure? Could it confirm that investment was indeed declining? Because if investment was indeed falling, the worst remedy to help it was to raise the interest rate.

## Impact of Drug Trafficking on the Economy

It must be acknowledged to the issuing bank that when Samper assumed the "reins" of power (I say reins in quotes not to question governability but because in reality the constitution left the reins in the hands of the issuing bank), conditions changed substantially, due to the persecution and capture of the main cartel members, with the consequences of a considerable decrease in this activity and the part of construction that they moved, which has caused a decrease in income and plunged the entire construction sector into crisis, and as everyone knows, construction guides a good percentage of large and small industries.

Ready, this gives reason back to the Bank of the Republic. For now, only regarding the diagnosis. "Consumption is very high, and there is very little savings level." But it must be added that income was also being affected.

## The Fallacy of High Rate Policy

What induced the issuer to say that the solution to discourage consumption was by raising the interest rate, thus reactivating savings?

I believe it necessary to warn that if we intend to see things from a scientific point of view, we must question everything, or at least learn to question everything.

If the intention was to decrease consumption, it is clear that with a high interest rate it can be achieved, especially in a credit economy like ours. And if we also increase the cost of services mercilessly, we not only decrease consumption expenses but can introduce numerous families to conditions of unsatisfied needs. On this side a purpose is achieved. And the other? Does this measure perhaps allow increasing savings? Hardly, or better, impossible.

Current account deposits and speculative money may increase, but these should not be confused with savings. Savings is as related to investment as the buyer to the seller in a sales contract, that without being identical the buyer and seller, the good that one sells is equal to the good that the other buys. Under these conditions, by making consumption decrease, an increase in savings is not achieved; on the contrary, high interest rates achieve a decrease in investment, and as a consequence, entail a decrease in savings. Tremendously paradoxical. If consumption decreases and savings decrease, then income decreases, that is, GDP.

## Counterproductive Effects

Thus both supply and demand are decreased and we can hardly say that inflation control is achieved, except perhaps temporarily, but very doubtful in the long term, since indeed, a decrease in supply on one hand, and an increase in monetary mass due to foreign speculative money, will soon show their effect, even if they manage to keep the exchange rate under "control." Additionally, the fact of altering equilibrium in this way has left us in such a fantastic situation that we now have a "hard" currency, with 20% inflation. Incredible. All for the temporary benefit, and who knows if permanent, of the external sector and large companies. Altering the interest rate means altering the entire system.

## The Injustice of the Current System

We perceive in the environment an unjust situation, in which by arbitrary measures we condemn companies to their "slow" extinction and an immense mass of workers to the undesirable state of unemployed, with their respective consequences. Let us observe the effect: companies sell less, their resources are not enough to cover fixed and variable costs, and if they have the misfortune of being indebted to banking, they will inevitably have to liquidate them and transfer the goods, generating unemployment.

## Proposal for Institutional Reform

There is no doubt, the functions of the Monetary Board must be regulated, its monastic power must be diminished, be oriented toward more general principles that allow providing equity, equilibrium, development and growth, without interfering in the general laws imposed by the free market. For example, obliging it in its operations that when it has to place securities its interest rate is always below the DTF in a range between 1 and 2 points, allowing the DTF rate to be set by the free market between monetary supply and money demand.

## The Theoretical Vacuum

However there is something that still does not work. We are not talking about a novel economic theory at all, to say that board members could overlook these reasonings.

Indeed, let Keynes speak: "...The influence of changes in the interest rate on the amount that is really saved is of vital importance, but is exercised in the opposite direction to what is generally supposed; because even when the attraction of a greater future income due to a higher interest rate has the consequence of diminishing the propensity to consume, we can be sure, nonetheless, that a rise in it will result in a reduction of the sum really saved. This is because total savings is determined by total investment; a rise in the interest rate (unless it is counteracted by a corresponding change in the investment demand curve) will lower investment; hence a rise in the rate must have the effect of reducing income to a level such that savings descend to the same extent as investment. Since income will fall by an absolute sum greater than investment, it is undoubted that when the interest rate rises, consumption declines; but this does not mean that there will therefore be a greater margin for savings; on the contrary, both (Savings and expenses) will decrease." Pg 104 "GENERAL THEORY OF EMPLOYMENT, INTEREST AND MONEY" EDITORIAL "FONDO DE CULTURA ECON√ìMICA".

## Hidden Interests

Therefore, what underlying interests might be moving? Undoubtedly, something that has to do with savings-investment promoting agents, such as recently created pension and severance funds, which require high returns especially in their beginnings to survive. But giving life to these funds in this way at the expense of small and medium enterprises again leaves us with that bitter taste of injustice caused by board management policies, although the government is not exempt from responsibility, which is also subsidizing the I.S.S. with the fiscal deficit through its placement of treasury securities, which are also giving a rate above their real value. These funds should be given greater participation in stock acquisition, but above all, allow them to participate in generating new companies, which is where they can truly foster the creation of real value both for the economy and for themselves. We thus understand why business octopi, including Banking, have not raised their voice in protest, if they see themselves doubly benefited, one as fund shareholders, and another, because they are slowly taking over the market, free of competition, seeing other competitors who do not have sufficient strength to negotiate their credits at cheaper rates, or get them abroad, disappear helplessly.

## Principles vs. Objectives

Seen from this perspective, I join those who think that the Issuing Bank should not function based on objectives, but based on principles that regulate market stability and security, and that it can channel abrupt economic jumps to reestablish equilibrium as soon as possible. But it is important that responsibility remain in the hands of the government, which is the one that will receive the bills for its management. So there will also be a need to regulate government objectives. It is the government that should have objectives, the issuer should be governed by principles.

## Crisis as a Product of Policies

Never before had we felt in such a paper crisis, so much from the desk, that we are assaulted by doubt that the board, with so much power in its hands, could be politicized, or failing that, by not belonging to the government, end up in the hands of banking interests, the only benefited sector, which shows once more that it is not possible to maintain the two entities, board and government, acting as independent islands.

## The Drug Trafficking Problem and Monetary Policy

In reality, controlling inflation is difficult, since it does not come only from the fiscal deficit, but drug trafficking, with all its export volume, somehow manages to penetrate its foreign currency, which added to those from oil and those brought by foreign investors, leave a practically inevitable panorama, which will tend to keep the exchange rate stable and consequently put other export lines, less profitable, in difficulties, but that is the free market system, and this is not the only country that suffers from it.

## Reflections on the War on Drugs

Since the impact of drug trafficking on different economies is so strong and its eradication almost impossible except at a very high social cost, it is imperative to understand that in this market buyer and seller participate in the same illicit activity, so it is not pertinent to treat producers as scum and consumers with compassion. If the latter decided to end their lives, whether by their own decision or because they found no meaning in their own society, not even God can prevent it, given that he respects the free will of his creature. Under these circumstances, consumers will always be willing to seek their market. As long as this demand exists, there will be important intermediaries both in producing countries and in consuming countries willing to transport the product to them, as long as man's heart continues to respond to the stimulus and greed for money. And as long as our "small" countries continue with large colonization zones and impenetrable jungles, with people bordering on misery, we will always find them willing to survive with the product of illicit crops.

Society will soon have to put on the scale the damage caused by the prohibited market, against what would be caused if this market were legalized. That is, the evil currently caused against consumers, the intestine wars between distributors and producers, the corruption of all society, the deaths of innocent civilians and soldiers that may be much higher than those of consumers alone, in addition to the destabilization of economies at the international level, etc., against the damage to consumers alone. And why not, give ourselves the possibility of finding a mechanism for the longed-for peace in our small producing countries. Peace to which we also have a right, and which Americans achieved when they legalized liquor in another era.

## Impact on Public Finances

We still need to analyze the effect that board measures cause on State finances. We understand that the real problem is not that public spending is very high, but that it has to be financed with credit. Since the most important items of the State are income from VAT and income tax, that is, from consumption and business profitability, it is clear in light of this discourse that its income has also been seriously affected, and since government spending is in general terms, postponable and necessary in order to generate the infrastructure required by different economic agents, it will be understood that the deficit is even greater than originally planned.

## Diagnosis Conclusion

Consequently, we can affirm, without fear of being wrong, that arbitrarily interfering in the real variables of the economy, and especially in the interest rate, is highly harmful and dangerous for all society. One should not think either that the solution is to modify the real value of the interest rate in the opposite direction, that is, below its real value.

We repeat, the best indicator and regulator of the economy is freedom of prices, freedom of competition, freedom of markets.

It could be affirmed that sooner or later the market would have the same effect, removing the incompetent from the ring, and that these measures only expedited an inevitable process. In this regard we argue that although it is possible for this to occur, it is different to see "market social justice" act, which in fact acts, and not that applied incoherently by man who generally alters not only ecological equilibrium, but also social and economic equilibrium.

It has been demonstrated that the crisis we are going through is of a profoundly economic, interest-based, and institutional nature, and its solution can only come from scientific knowledge of economic laws and coherent action.
