## THE PROBLEM OF INERTIAL INFLATION

**By Mauricio Rivadeneira Mora**

Inflation is above all a problem that could be handled with mere common sense. Its roots are various, some already discovered by thought, and the most elementary of them has man locked in a vicious circle, which does not let him see, additionally accompanied by a feeling of guilt that moves his unconscious to punishment.

One of its elements is the excess of existing money over what is strictly necessary for goods to circulate. This has been called inflation due to excess monetary supply, or what is the same, demand inflation, or that demand exceeds supply.

Since the quantitative equation that has recognized the evolution of human thought, (P.Q = M.V) only contemplates the relationship of prices "P" and quantities "Q" of products with the monetary mass "M", while the expression "V", velocity of money circulation only reflects the part of the equation about which we can say practically nothing, except that it is the right value to make the equation equivalent or equal, that is, there is a limitation of knowledge, we must understand why over time only the part of inflation that has to do with the purely monetary effect has been seen, neglecting others that are really of more weight and important in what concerns inflation, such as cost inflation, within which we can locate interest rates as the cyclical element that has not let us see the phenomenon in all its dimension.

To address this difficulty we are going to suggest an analytical method that allows us to conclude once and for all, the way to obtain clear control over inflation.

Let us take for our analysis the income statement, or profit and loss of a company.

Its first line, **sales,** are the result of the product $P.Q. (Similar to the quantitative equation, only for a single company). Expressed in words it means the price "$P" of goods times the quantities of products "Q" sold in the period. -Like when a company makes an invoice.- Added all the $P.Q of the year, gives us the first line of the profit and loss statement: Sales.

This means that companies are obviously connected with macroeconomic policies regarding money supply or monetary mass M, through prices $P, as expressed by the quantitative equation. To observe it better, let us initially suppose that everything is balanced in our equation. That is, prices P, the quantity of products Q, the mass of money in circulation M, and the velocity of money circulation V, are all "constants". Now suppose the government increases money M, the consequence will be that prices P rise to balance the equation. This is what theory has recognized.

But on the other hand, sales "$P.Q", are also equal to the company's costs and expenses, plus financial expenses plus tax expenses plus profits, according to the income statement or P&L. Since the selling price is set by companies once all these expenses plus profits are included, we must see that prices are directly connected to each of the costs, **including interest expenses**. Any cost that increases and acts equally in all companies will directly impact the price level.

Thus, to control prices $P, it is not only necessary to regulate monetary mass M, but also each of the company's costs. For example, if public services rise, prices will increase to the extent that this extra cost will act on all productive units and families. But these costs will not act inertially or permanently, or monthly, significantly, since it would require services to also rise monthly. The nature of inertial inflation must be sought in interest, and this is why we have underlined them.

One could even think of raw materials or wages, but these normally also increase as a reaction to a previous movement of another variable.

In general, sales costs and administration and sales expenses have a tendency to gradually decrease as an effect of competition between different companies, which would mean that prices would also tend to gradually decrease, so these costs cannot be responsible for inertial inflation.

But even interest can be disaggregated into two components, namely deposit interest plus intermediation interest. That is, placement interest, or interest that banks charge their clients when they request credit, includes deposit interest plus intermediation interest. And with intermediation interest the same can happen, due to competition between banks, this intermediation margin can tend to gradually decrease, which would make prices also tend to decrease.

But with deposit interest, or DTF in Colombia, the opposite happens, and it is not surprising that the interest rate is responsible for inertial inflation, since in itself, this variable has maintained its transcendental importance throughout economic theory.

The deposit interest rate is explosive in nature, and acts in such a way in the system, that banking competition to capture more resources makes them offer more interest to money holders. This means that the deposit rate has an inertial tendency to increase, which will in turn make prices have an inertial tendency to increase, since it is also a cost for companies. And since the one who imposes the minimum point to the deposit rate is the Central Bank, we must look there for most of the problems that afflict the economy.

However, it is not necessary for the rate to vary continuously to generate inertial inflation. For example when we say a fixed DTF deposit rate of 10%, since it is a fee that will act generally, monthly, this extra cost that will impact all companies and families, will generate an increase in prices, also monthly.

This conclusion is very important and transcendental, since it is telling us that to be able to control inflation one must **first** lower the deposit interest rate, and not as is traditionally done, wait for inflation to fall first in order to lower the interest rate.

Now, when costs increase transactions require more money, which must be supplied to prevent the interest rate from continuing to rise. Since the interest rate even remaining fixed produces inflation after a certain value, one will have the sensation that money issuance is directly responsible for inflation since these are the two variables that are seen acting simultaneously, and thus, cost inflation and monetary effect inflation are similar giving the impression that they should be handled in the same way. Such has been the cause of confusion.

We can conclude, that when the entire system is operating under the free market scheme of supply and demand, and all cost variables are reaching their lower limit, if inflation still occurs, it is because the deposit interest rate must continue decreasing to the point where inflation equals zero. If we observe the deposit interest rate and inflation index of different countries, it seems that zero inflation will occur when the rate is between 0% and 3%, provided that other variables are at their minimum or close to it.
