# CHAPTER II

**HOW INTEREST RATES INFLUENCE THE ECONOMY**

## (AND WHY IT IS POSSIBLE TO LOWER THE DEPOSIT RATE BEFORE INFLATION FALLS)

**Santa Fe de Bogot√°, October 1996**

In the previous chapter we made a diagnosis of the economic situation that Colombia is currently experiencing, and found that the fundamental problem lies in the management of the interest rate. We found that the Monetary Board has been applying a restrictive monetary policy with the purpose of decreasing consumption and raising savings, but in practice has produced exactly the opposite: it has decreased both consumption and savings, and therefore, national income.

In this chapter we will develop in greater depth the theory that sustains this affirmation, and demonstrate why it is possible and necessary to lower the deposit rate before inflation falls.

## The Relationship between Interest Rate and Investment

To understand why high interest rates are detrimental to the economy, we must start from the analysis of the relationship between the interest rate and investment. This relationship, developed by Keynes in his General Theory, establishes that there is an inverse relationship between both variables.

Entrepreneurs make investment decisions by comparing the marginal efficiency of capital (the expected rate of return on investment) with the market interest rate. They will only undertake those projects whose expected rate of return is higher than the cost of financing.

When the interest rate is very high, many projects that would be profitable with normal rates cease to be so. This reduces the aggregate level of investment in the economy.

## The Multiplier Effect

The reduction in investment has amplified effects on the economy through the multiplier mechanism. An initial decrease in investment translates into a more than proportional reduction in national income.

The multiplier operates as follows:
- Lower investment reduces demand for capital goods
- This reduces employment and income in capital goods producing industries
- The income reduction of these workers reduces their consumption
- Lower demand for consumer goods again reduces employment and income
- The process continues in successive rounds

## The Savings Paradox

One of the most important aspects of restrictive monetary policy is what Keynes called the "savings paradox." Although the declared intention of raising interest rates was to increase savings, the real result is exactly the opposite.

This occurs because savings and investment must be equal in any economy (savings-investment identity). If high interest rates reduce investment, savings must be reduced by the same magnitude.

The reduction in savings does not occur because families decide to save less, but because their incomes are reduced as a consequence of lower economic activity. With lower incomes, both consumption and savings decrease.

## Real vs. Nominal Interest Rate

It is important to distinguish between the nominal interest rate (the one observed in the market) and the real interest rate (nominal minus expected inflation rate).

For economic decisions, what matters is the real rate. In Colombia, with 20% inflation and nominal rates of 35-40%, real rates are in the range of 15-20%, levels excessively high for any economy.

Developed countries typically operate with real rates of 2-4%. The level of real rates in Colombia is incompatible with sustained economic growth.

## Cost Inflation vs. Demand Inflation

The traditional justification for maintaining high interest rates is to control inflation. However, it is crucial to understand what type of inflation is being faced.

**Demand Inflation**: Occurs when aggregate demand exceeds productive capacity. In this case, restrictive monetary policies can be effective.

**Cost Inflation**: Originates from increases in production costs (wages, raw materials, energy, financial costs). Restrictive monetary policies are not only ineffective but counterproductive.

**Inertial Inflation**: Is perpetuated by indexation mechanisms and expectations. Requires structural reforms, not necessarily restrictive monetary policy.

In Colombia, evidence suggests that inflation obeys mainly cost and inertia factors, not excess demand.

## Why it is Possible to Lower Rates before Inflation

Contrary to conventional wisdom, it is possible and advisable to reduce interest rates before inflation falls:

### 1. Reduction of Financial Costs
By lowering rates, companies' financial costs are reduced, which contributes to moderating inflation on the cost side.

### 2. Supply Stimulus
Lower rates stimulate investment, increasing productive capacity. Greater supply helps contain inflationary pressures.

### 3. Better Expectations
A credible policy of gradual rate reduction can help anchor inflationary expectations downward.

### 4. Appropriate Real Rates
Reducing nominal rates while maintaining some level of inflation results in more reasonable real rates for economic activity.

## The Open Economy Case

In an open economy like Colombia, high interest rates have additional effects:

- They attract speculative capital that appreciates the currency
- Appreciation reduces export competitiveness
- The trade balance deteriorates
- Dependence on volatile capital flows is created

These effects are particularly harmful for a developing country that needs to promote its exports.

## Implementation Mechanisms

To successfully implement a rate reduction requires:

### 1. Graduality
The reduction must be gradual and predictable so as not to generate destabilizing expectations.

### 2. Policy Coordination
It is fundamental to coordinate monetary policy with fiscal policy to avoid inconsistencies.

### 3. Structural Reforms
Simultaneously, automatic indexation mechanisms that perpetuate inflationary inertia must be eliminated.

### 4. Clear Communication
The central bank must clearly communicate its intentions and the fundamentals of the policy.

## International Experience

Many countries have successfully implemented interest rate reduction policies as part of stabilization programs:

- **Chile** (1990s): Gradually reduced rates while maintaining fiscal discipline
- **Israel** (1980s): Combined rate reduction with structural reforms
- **Brazil** (Real Plan): Used exchange rate anchor and gradual rate reduction

These cases show that it is possible to reduce rates without unleashing inflationary processes, provided it is accompanied by appropriate complementary policies.

## Risks and Mitigation

The proposed strategy is not without risks:

### Risks:
- Possible inflationary rebound if the reduction is too abrupt
- Exchange pressures from speculative capital outflows
- Loss of credibility if not implemented consistently

### Mitigation:
- Gradual and well-communicated implementation
- Coordination with fiscal policy
- Reforms to eliminate automatic indexation
- Continuous monitoring of key indicators

## Expected Benefits

The benefits of a more moderate rate policy include:

1. **Investment Recovery**: Lower real rates will stimulate postponed investment projects
2. **Employment Growth**: Greater investment will generate direct and indirect jobs
3. **Consumption Increase**: Lower financial costs will free resources for consumption
4. **Better Competitiveness**: Lower rates will reduce pressure toward exchange appreciation
5. **Corporate Recovery**: Indebted companies will be able to restructure their liabilities

## The Role of Expectations

Expectations play a crucial role in the success of any economic policy. If economic agents perceive that rate reduction is part of a coherent and sustainable program, this can contribute to:

- Improve business confidence
- Stimulate investment decisions
- Stabilize inflationary expectations
- Facilitate normalization of credit conditions

## Conclusions

Theoretical and empirical evidence supports the convenience of abandoning the policy of excessively high interest rates. The main arguments are:

1. **High rates have failed** to achieve their declared objectives of increasing savings and controlling inflation.

2. **Colombian inflation** obeys more to structural factors than to excess demand.

3. **It is possible to reduce rates** before inflation falls, through gradual and coordinated implementation.

4. **Benefits outweigh risks**, especially if accompanied by complementary reforms.

5. **International experience** shows that this strategy can be successful.

The country urgently needs a change of approach in monetary policy that privileges growth, employment and competitiveness, without neglecting price stability. Current real interest rate levels are unsustainable for an economy that aspires to grow and develop.
