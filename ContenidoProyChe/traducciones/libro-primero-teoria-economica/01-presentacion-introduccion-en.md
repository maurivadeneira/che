## PRESENTATION

I submit for consideration by the scientific community of economists in Colombia this essay that seeks to explain and provide a solution to the current economic situation that Colombia is experiencing.

The essay delves into economic laws to show that Colombia's crisis is not accidental, but rather entirely logical from every point of view, in accordance with the economic policy that has traditionally governed Colombia.

As guiding texts in this research, I have particularly studied the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money by J.M. KEYNES, the books by Professor ALLEN, such as his Mathematical Analysis for Economists and his Mathematical Economics, and the Theories of Economic Development by Mrs. IRMA ADELMAN.

I must say that the contribution of Professor SAMUELSON's texts with his Course in Modern Economics, and Professor ACKLEY with his Macroeconomic Theory, has also been considerable.

Many other texts on various topics have also been researched, including those on international trade.

I consider vital the influence I have received from the Physical sciences, which have allowed me to establish very useful analogies for understanding the laws of economics.

I hope this essay will help Colombian economists and the various governmental entities responsible for providing economic management guidelines in the task of finding an adequate solution to the current crisis that afflicts us.

## INTRODUCTION

The nature of the crisis that Colombia is currently experiencing merits a complete study of economic theory that allows comparing two systems that move simultaneously under completely different economic policy applications: On one side, an international context where interest rates are relatively low, and on the other, countries that for one reason or another chose to allow considerably higher rates, protecting their economy through considerable tariffs.

It is a fact that when tariff protections are lifted, one of the two systems will be in a better position and the other, as we say colloquially, will end up paying.

Conceptual economics has not yielded its space to applied economics, much less to econometric models. On the contrary, when these models enter crisis, it is necessary to return to reviewing both economic concepts and the principles on which the models are based.

The crisis we are experiencing in Colombia, I maintain, must be sought not in trade relations nor in the supposed uncompetitiveness of our productive agents, but in the principles on which the management of our economic policy has been based.

When developing economies seek to enter the international context through opening processes, these must be coherent with a multiplicity of factors, among which the adequate management of interest rates and monetary variables must be fundamentally contemplated. By taking measures only with respect to the real variables of the economy, that is, opening the system to freedom of imports, one can induce a strengthening of banking to the detriment of consumption and the stability of productive companies, giving the appearance that opening only produces benefits for more developed countries, leaving developing countries as yet more victims of the voracious capitalist system.

We will demonstrate in this work that this is not so.

### Fundamental Thesis

The fundamental thesis of these articles consists of affirming that the interest rate in a country that decides on opening should be such that the deposit rate of the financial system should be placed in the order of 3%, and the intermediation rate at no more than 7%, to give parity to the different exchange relations with the rest of the world, this being a necessary but not sufficient condition for the developing country not to be harmed either in its employment level or in the level of its gross domestic product.

We demonstrate in this work why it should be so, why it is not impossible to administratively force the system so that rates take these values, why the high interest rate is what induces inertial-type inflation, and why the Colombian government has been wrong in managing the DTF (Deposit rate in Colombia) since it decided to "tie it" to the inflation index.

These demonstrations are conceptual and not econometric. Let us remember that it was not thanks to regression models that Newton postulated that force equals mass times acceleration, nor did Keynes deduce his investment multiplier model from an econometric model.

### Methodological Approach

In general, theoretical economics is concerned with the equilibrium point, both static and dynamic. The developed models propose a series of n equations with n unknowns, in whose solution they seek the interest rate compatible with equilibrium, if it exists. The mathematical result is that there are usually many values that this variable can take, which does not give much light to applied economics.

Somehow its application has been transferred to the practical level, and it is generally accepted that the interest rate is an independent variable, although with the possibility of moving or changing to make the system compatible with equilibrium, according to how the other variables of the system are developing. Under no circumstances is it contemplated that this could be "rigorously rigid" at a determined value, although some authors (that I at least know of) have suggested it timidly. Thus, the interest rate moves to seek equilibrium, although in practice in some countries it may be quite stable for long periods.

In this work, we reverse the relationship. In fact, we know that by fixing a value to the interest rate, the entire productive system and exchange relations will seek their stability around this rate. We postulate that this rate refers to the deposit rate of the financial system. That is, the marginal efficiency of capital will reach the point where it equals the deposit interest rate, without neglecting that there are other variables that will also influence, such as, for example, the percentage of taxes, etc.

From this perspective, it remains to determine what is the interest rate that could optimize the system, since it is not recommended that it be equal to zero, a point where the "engine" of capitalism would disappear: competition. Of course, we do not address this mathematical exercise that would lead us to suppose the existence of a natural interest rate capable of bringing the economic system to its maximum utility.

We fix this value "capriciously" at 3%, since it is the value traditionally spoken of in all texts, and the one that in practice seems to be commonly accepted by economies that have not let themselves be overwhelmed by inflation.

If more rigor is desired, the minimum value of the deposit rate that could be postulated for countries that decide on opening should be equal to that of the most developed country whose rate is the lowest among them. This will prevent there being unnatural advantages in the level of competition of companies, by allowing the cost of money to be equal for all.

### Study Scope

This work is eminently theoretical, although it uses the Colombian case as an example. I maintain that we have objective laws in economics, therefore these cannot depend on whether they are applied in one country or another. I simply take these laws and use them to explain what is happening to us and what we should do. No figures are given for the Colombian economy either before opening began, or from the moment the crisis started, or for consecutive periods of the crisis, which we affirm will continue as long as the deposit rate continues to be well above 3%. In Colombia the rate has generally oscillated above 20% and has even reached levels of 30% before opening, and with inflation indices that have also oscillated at these same levels, of course, as was to be expected, a few points below the interest rate. While before opening these levels were sustainable and manageable for being above all nominal, with opening these values became perfectly real for everyone, to the point that there is no way to ask that a company that in Colombia gets resources at almost 45% interest can compete with one from the USA that gets the same resources at no more than 9%.

Although reference is made only to Colombia, for an economist from any latitude it will not be difficult to understand what is being discussed, and I do not doubt that they will agree that the study is susceptible to generalization.

### Variable Control Proposal

It is argued in the work that it is not appropriate for a government to maintain all its economic variables over which it can have some control, such as taxes, bank reserves, monetary supply, interest rate, etc., subject to permanent changes, since equilibrium, whether static or with growth, will be an impossible task to maintain since some variables influence others, and with some the effects of others can be counteracted.

As an example, observe how putting the DTF (Deposit rate in Colombia) a few points above inflation leaves completely useless the release of money to modify the interest rate, "sending" all its effect directly to the price level. This is demonstrated in the third chapter, "ECONOMICS -VS- PLANNING." It is argued that the ideal is to be able to leave one or two variables fixed, for example, the interest rate and the tax rate, so that through another variable, for example monetary supply, it can be manipulated over time in such a way that it fixes or maintains in reasonable stability a third or fourth variable such as the price index. This would be "taking the bull by the horns," to allow the system to develop, perhaps not as we would like, but at a point close to optimal.

### Critique of Institutional Separation

We argue that definitively when we speak of economics we must necessarily refer to a totalizing system, therefore when in Colombia we have separated the management of real variables of the economy under the central government, and monetary variables under the monetary board, nothing more than a dangerous blunder has been made, since the Board can easily end up responding to banking interests, or be politicized and strongly oppose government policies, or remain in the clouds theorizing from a cold academy, thinking it has no responsibility to the Nation's productive forces.

### Predictive Capacity

This point is developed in the first chapter, "ECONOMIC SCIENCE AND ITS CURRENT APPLICATION IN COLOMBIA," which shows how it is possible to make predictions in economics. The basic postulates of economics have been taken, and a development has been made of what we could expect when raising the interest rate.

This chapter began to take shape during the second semester of 1995, when the Monetary Board began talking about overheating of the economy, and that the savings level was very low in Colombia, which motivated it to raise the interest rate. The chapter was finished in July 1996, so the predictions made there begin to be clearly seen during 1997.

Thus, the chapter predicts increased unemployment, decreased Gross Domestic Product, consolidation of economic groups, disappearance of small and medium industry, etc., not as a product of fortunate guesses, but from the judicious application of economic arguments that Keynes had already analyzed in his time, in addition to finding these arguments in any economics text.

Likewise, it shows how the system has been crying out for interest rates to be lowered (in general, prices always indicate what should be done), therefore it is particularly important to investigate the reasons why the Monetary Board resists lowering the rate.

### Identification of the Real Problem

Ultimately, the article shows how the government is not to blame with its fiscal deficit, but is one more victim, like the entire system, of the application of monetary policy by the Board of the Issuing Bank. But if we are going to be fair, the theoretical error is not easy to elucidate, so it is not enough to say that it is an error to maintain interest rates so high, but it is necessary to explain very thoroughly why, and even more, how much they should fall and how to do it.

The value of this first article lies in being predictive-explanatory, easily contrasted with events almost a year later, when other colleagues have barely come up with the diagnosis although not yet with the solution that is suggested here.

### Limitations of Econometric Models

Let us clarify further why I think the econometric models developed and applied in these countries to plan economic policies cannot serve in a case like this, neither to plan, nor to predict, nor to find an adequate solution.

First, a model of n equations with n unknowns, to be fed with historical values that determine initial conditions, requires regularity in the rules of the game that allow inducing that constants, if any, are reasonably constant. In Colombia this situation has not occurred, much less when opening began, when it could be supposed that practically all values would be modified.

Indeed, parameters such as the propensity to consume, from which the investment multiplier is derived, has had to vary so greatly in recent years that we must necessarily say that any prediction that contemplates this value will be automatically biased in an unpredictable way.

### Scientific Approach vs. Empiricism

For our purposes we use the equality of saving and investment at all times, and if this serves us to make predictions, then it is evidence in favor of this model. If someone is uncomfortable with it, I will generalize, arguing that as I see the discussion of the equality or not of saving-investment, if I understand correctly, I would say we can take saving as the sum of planned and unplanned saving, and investment as the sum of induced investment with planned investment. Under these conditions saving and investment will continue to be equal both ex-ante and ex-post, although it does not mean that from one period to another it cannot be different, leaving this explanation as a development of the model proposed by Keynes, and not as a different economy. The same could be said of the different multiplier-accelerator models.

I resist accepting that economic science is just numbers. These will unquestionably corroborate theories by contrasting them with reality, but we must not fall into the temptation that numbers are science and the last word. This is why I think that in Colombia a true diagnosis has not really been made, because otherwise we would already know what to do.

Indeed, saying for example that recession is due to high interest rates, that construction is paralyzed, that dollar revaluation is strangling exporters, and that producers cannot compete with imports and smuggling, is not a diagnosis at all, but simply a description, so to speak, in figures, something like a photograph, but not a diagnosis, which should be able to explain in detail why each of these elements occurs, and suggest correctives.

Thus, the first chapter of this work resembles more a diagnosis, although it is not complete.

### Work Structure

This work initially, and at all times, only sought to find a way out of the problems that were coming to Colombia, and that it currently suffers with all its rigor, without being able to say that rock bottom has been reached. However, the way the topic has been treated I believe has exceeded its initial intention, and has allowed generalizing the theory at a global level, which in my understanding makes this work also of global interest.

In the text and throughout all chapters, diagnosis is interspersed with solutions and theory, simultaneously.

The first chapter is informative only for Colombia's situation. For purposes of understanding the theses presented, reading can begin from the second chapter, from which the theory forms a congruent whole.

In the fifth chapter the most important conclusions of the work are extracted, and in accordance with these, specific recommendations for the Colombian case are elaborated. The proposal is shock therapy, and I hope it will be discussed, accepted, and eventually improved by my Colombian colleagues.
