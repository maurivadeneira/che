# CHAPTER V

**CONCLUSIONS AND ECONOMIC POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Santa Fe de Bogotá, December 1996**

After exhaustively analyzing the problems of Colombian economic policy during the period 1995-1997, and developing a theoretical framework that explains inflationary mechanisms and their interrelations, we are in a position to formulate definitive conclusions and specific economic policy recommendations.

## GENERAL CONCLUSIONS

### 1. Erroneous Diagnosis of Inflation

The main failure of Colombian economic policy in this period has been the erroneous diagnosis of the type of inflation affecting the country. Monetary authorities have treated Colombian inflation as if it were primarily demand-driven, when in reality it is fundamentally cost-driven and structural.

This diagnostic confusion has led to the application of restrictive monetary policies that have not only been ineffective in controlling inflation, but have been frankly counterproductive, feeding the very phenomenon they intended to combat.

### 2. The Vicious Circle of High Interest Rates

The excessively high interest rates applied in Colombia have created a vicious circle:

**High Rates → Higher Financial Costs → Greater Cost Inflation → Inflationary Expectations → Demand for Higher Rates → Cycle Repetition**

This vicious circle has been the main cause of inflationary persistence and the economic contraction observed.

### 3. The Savings Paradox Confirmed

Empirical data fully confirm the theoretical prediction known as the "savings paradox." The attempt to increase national savings through high interest rates has resulted in exactly the opposite:

- **National Savings**: Decreased as percentage of GDP
- **Private Investment**: Contracted dramatically
- **Economic Growth**: Fell below potential

### 4. Incoherence between Policies

There is a fundamental contradiction between the economic opening policy adopted by Colombia and the restrictive monetary policy implemented simultaneously:

- **Economic Opening**: Requires competitiveness and exchange rate stability
- **Restrictive Monetary Policy**: Attracts speculative capital and appreciates currency
- **Result**: Monetary policy nullifies the benefits of opening

### 5. Regressive Distributive Effects

High interest rates have had highly regressive distributive effects:

- **Beneficiaries**: Rentiers and financial speculators
- **Harmed**: Producers, employees, and consumers
- **Result**: Income concentration and social deterioration

## SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS

### MONETARY POLICY

#### 1. Gradual Reduction of Interest Rates

**Objective**: Bring real interest rates to levels compatible with marginal productivity of capital (2-4% annually).

**Suggested Timeline**:
- **Month 1-3**: Reduce deposit rates from 30% to 25%
- **Month 4-6**: Reduce from 25% to 20%
- **Month 7-12**: Gradually reduce to 15%
- **Year 2**: Stabilize around 12-15% (with decreasing inflation)

**Justification**: Gradual reduction allows anchoring expectations without creating financial turbulence.

#### 2. Clear Communication of Strategy

The Monetary Board must clearly communicate:
- **Theoretical foundations** of the new policy
- **Timeline for rate reduction**
- **Indicators** that will guide adjustments
- **Commitment** to medium-term price stability

#### 3. Use of Quantitative Instruments

Prefer control of **monetary aggregates** over direct control of **interest rates**:
- Establish growth targets for M1 and M2
- Allow rates to be determined by market forces
- Intervene only when rates deviate excessively from target levels

### FISCAL POLICY

#### 4. Fiscal-Monetary Coordination

**Principle**: Fiscal policy must complement, not contradict, monetary policy.

**Specific Measures**:
- **Maintain fiscal discipline**: Deficit no greater than 2% of GDP
- **Improve spending quality**: Prioritize productive public investment
- **Structural tax reform**: Broaden tax base, reduce rates
- **Eliminate distorting subsidies**: Especially financial subsidies

#### 5. Income Policy

- **Tripartite agreements**: Government, employers, workers
- **Limited indexation**: Eliminate automatic wage indexation
- **Productivity**: Link wage increases to productivity increments

### EXCHANGE RATE POLICY

#### 6. Controlled Exchange Rate Flexibility

**Recommended Regime**: Exchange rate band with flexibility for competitive adjustments.

**Objectives**:
- **Competitiveness**: Maintain competitive real exchange rate
- **Stability**: Avoid excessive volatility
- **Coherence**: Coordinate with monetary policy

**Instruments**:
- Exchange rate band of ±5% around central parity
- Gradual adjustments of central parity
- Sterilized interventions in extreme cases

### STRUCTURAL REFORMS

#### 7. Financial System

**Objective**: Develop an efficient financial system that serves the real sector.

**Measures**:
- **Prudential regulation**: Strengthen banking supervision
- **Competition**: Facilitate entry of new intermediaries
- **Transparency**: Improve information on rates and services
- **Capital markets**: Develop alternatives to bank credit

#### 8. Labor Market

**Prudent flexibilization**:
- **Contracts**: Diversify contractual modalities
- **Training**: Invest in human capital formation
- **Mobility**: Facilitate sectoral employment reallocation

#### 9. Institutional Framework

**Institutional strengthening**:
- **Independence**: Technical autonomy of central bank
- **Transparency**: Periodic accountability
- **Credibility**: Consistency over time of policies
- **Coordination**: Formal coordination mechanisms between authorities

## LESSONS FOR OTHER COUNTRIES

The Colombian experience offers valuable lessons for other developing countries:

### 1. Importance of Correct Diagnosis

**Lesson**: It is crucial to correctly identify the type of inflation before designing policies.

**Application**: Countries with structural inflation should avoid excessively restrictive monetary policies.

### 2. Policy Coherence

**Lesson**: Different economic policies must be consistent with each other.

**Application**: Economic opening requires coherent monetary and exchange rate policies.

### 3. Gradualism vs. Shock

**Lesson**: In economies with high inflationary inertia, gradualism may be more effective than shock therapies.

**Application**: Gradual and well-communicated changes generate less resistance and better results.

### 4. Role of Expectations

**Lesson**: Economic agents' expectations are crucial for any policy's success.

**Application**: Clear communication and institutional credibility are fundamental.

### 5. Distribution of Costs and Benefits

**Lesson**: Policies that concentrate benefits and socialize costs tend to be politically unsustainable.

**Application**: Seek policies that generate widely distributed benefits.

## FINAL CONSIDERATIONS

### The Responsibility of Economists

Economists have the responsibility to:
1. **Correctly diagnose** economic problems
2. **Clearly communicate** our findings
3. **Propose viable solutions** that are technically sound
4. **Rigorously evaluate** policy results

### The Importance of Academic Debate

Open academic debate is fundamental to:
1. **Contrast theories** with empirical evidence
2. **Generate consensus** on solid technical bases
3. **Improve the quality** of public policies
4. **Strengthen economic** democracy

### Commitment to Social Welfare

Economic policy must always be oriented toward:
1. **Improving the welfare** of the population
2. **Promoting growth** with equity
3. **Guaranteeing sustainability** of development
4. **Strengthening democratic** institutions

## FINAL REFLECTION

The Colombian experience of 1995-1997 demonstrates that economic ideas have real consequences in people's lives. Poorly designed economic policies can generate unemployment, reduce incomes, and create unnecessary social suffering.

Therefore, it is fundamental that economic policymakers:
- **Base their decisions on rigorous analysis**
- **Consider all consequences** of their actions
- **Maintain humility** to recognize errors and correct course
- **Always prioritize general welfare** over particular interests

Economics is a social science at the service of humanity. Its ultimate objective must be to contribute to building more prosperous, equitable, and just societies.

This analysis has sought to provide elements for better understanding economic phenomena and for designing more effective policies. We hope it contributes to academic debate and, ultimately, to the welfare of our peoples.
