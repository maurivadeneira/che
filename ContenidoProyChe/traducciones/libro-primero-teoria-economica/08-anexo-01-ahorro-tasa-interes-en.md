## SAVINGS AND INTEREST RATE, A PROFOUND CONCEPTUAL ERROR

**By Mauricio Rivadeneira Mora**

For all countries in the world, their savings rate is a factor of constant concern, since the amount of savings depends on the investment that can be made, and these new investments are what make the economy grow.

However, savings in economics is a concept that has nothing to do with the amount of money that can be deposited in a bank in exchange for an interest rate.

A high interest rate openly conflicts with savings, making it smaller. A paradoxical situation contrary to the most elementary common sense.

But within economic theory its demonstration is rather simple, and already in his time John Maynard Keynes, the most celebrated and brilliant of all economists of this century warned of the error of trying to increase savings through a high interest rate. Indeed, let us see the following paragraph:

"...The influence of changes in the rate of interest on the amount that is actually saved is of vital importance, but it operates in the opposite direction to that generally supposed; for even though the attraction of a larger future income due to a higher rate of interest may result in reducing the propensity to consume, we can be sure, nevertheless, that a rise in it will result in a reduction in the amount actually saved. This is because total saving is determined by total investment; a rise in the interest rate (unless it is offset by a corresponding change in the investment demand curve) will lower investment; hence a rise in the rate must have the effect of reducing income to such a level that savings fall by the same amount as investment. Since income will fall by an absolute amount greater than investment, it is undoubtedly true that when the interest rate rises, the consumption rate falls; but this does not mean that there will therefore be a greater margin for saving; on the contrary, both (savings and expenses) will decrease."

This conclusion is of such transcendence that there is no economics text, however elementary, that does not warn about this paradox, or as economists frequently say, about this fallacy.

But in Colombia, we have long maintained a very high interest rate compared to the rate at the international level.

Indeed, the deposit rate or DTF in Colombia has been above 20% for a long time, against an international margin that can oscillate between 3% and 5%. This rate is actually imposed by the Issuing Bank in any country.

If the effect of raising the interest rate is to decrease both savings and consumption, it means that when comparing two different interest rates, the lower rate will allow greater savings. And if we take the inference to its limit, we should say that the lowest possible interest rate is what will allow the highest possible savings.

And in that case, if the lowest possible rate is between 3% and 5%, which is what exists in the international field, it means that contrary to all our policies in Colombia, the DTF interest rate should drop from 22% to 3%, since we are sacrificing growth possibilities, while we remain in a permanent semi-depression.

Let us return to Keynes: "Thus the remedy for the boom is not a higher rate of interest but a lower one!; for that may make the so-called boom last. The right remedy for the trade cycle is not to be found by abolishing booms and thus keeping us permanently in a semi-slump; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom."

Let us demonstrate the absurdity of continuing with the policy of high interest rates.

As a first measure, it is good to understand that once the Issuing Bank or the Government sets the minimum deposit rate, suppose they arbitrarily say 10%, at that moment all the forces of the free market will tend to make all the variables of the system find their new equilibrium point around this rate. That is, if the interest rate rises, some companies will disappear, until those that remain are in equilibrium with the new market conditions. And if the interest rate falls, companies will be able to grow until they equal their marginal efficiency of capital with this new interest rate. In general, when we modify the deposit interest rate, we arbitrarily move market conditions and force the system to move from one equilibrium point to another different equilibrium point.

From what has been said, we can conclude that we can certainly move the interest rate, regardless of any condition, up or down but being subject to strong variations, which are those caused by going from one equilibrium point to another. There is no valid argument that prevents raising or lowering the DTF, just as there is no valid argument for fixing it at 22%, or 28%, as has traditionally been done in Colombia.

On the other hand, there is a valid argument to affirm that the deposit interest rate should be as low as possible, and this is around 3%, as occurs at the international level, an approximate rate that we can find in all the countries we call developed and also in countries that have shown broad benefits in opening processes, while those that present serious problems have as a common element having a deposit rate well above 3%, as well as excessive inflation, which we can argue is due to the effect of the same interest rate.

It is not difficult to analyze why, if we give a vision to the composition of costs in a company, understanding that interest is a fundamental part of the component of these costs and expenses.

In general, all cost components, such as: **1.** cost of sales, **2.** administration and sales expenses, and **3.** banking intermediation interest, have something in common: due to competition between different sectors, the tendency of these costs is to be minimized. Meanwhile, deposit interest has an explosive tendency. (Note: when a company asks for a loan, the interest rate at which the financial intermediary lends is the DTF plus the intermediation points that the Bank earns).

Indeed, once the Central Bank sets the level of its minimum deposit rate, let's say 5%, competition among banks to capture more resources leads them to offer savers higher margins, which in turn become a cost for banking, which will be transmitted to investors, a cost that they will in turn transmit to the final product or to the intermediary, thus increasing the price level. But when limits are placed on price increases, through opening processes, then entrepreneurs will have a real cost that they cannot compete against, and they will have no choice but to reduce their investment or disappear, since competition now becomes with companies whose interest costs are much lower.

Thus, the higher interest rate causes investment to decrease, and consequently savings as well, since in economics savings equals investment, as recorded in all economics texts, however elementary they may be, and which we in Colombia are determined to contradict.

We are talking about a profound conceptual error, which makes us go against practically all the laws or general principles accepted by economic theory.

**A PROFOUND ERROR THAT MUST BE CORRECTED.**
