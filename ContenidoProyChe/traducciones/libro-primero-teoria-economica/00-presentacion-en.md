I submit for consideration by the scientific community of economists in Colombia, this essay that seeks to explain and provide a solution to the current economic situation that Colombia is going through.

The essay delves into economic laws to show that Colombia's crisis is not accidental, but from every logical point of view, in accordance with the economic policy that has traditionally governed Colombia.

As guiding texts in this research, I have particularly delved into the General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money, by J.M.KEYNES, in the books of Professor ALLEN, such as his Mathematical Analysis for Economists and his Mathematical Economics, and in the Theories of Economic Development by Mrs. IRMA ADELMAN.

I must say that the contribution of Professor SAMUELSON's texts with his Course in Modern Economics, and Professor ACKLEY with his Macroeconomic Theory has also been considerable.

Many other texts on various topics have also been researched, including those on international trade.

I consider the influence I have received from the Physical sciences to be of vital importance, which have allowed me to establish very useful analogies for the same understanding of the laws of economics.

I hope that this essay will help Colombian economists and the different government entities in charge of providing economic management guidelines, in the task of finding an adequate solution to the current crisis that afflicts us.
