## WORLD ECONOMY SOS (APRIL 1998)

**By Mauricio Rivadeneira Mora**

Currently it is difficult to find consensus among economists around economic theory, which is very tinted with popular belief, and even personal opinion, even within the economists' guild.

And if that weren't enough, the theory itself seems to be on terrain very far from reality, so much so that the models proposed to explain the economic universe remain in a purely mathematical exercise regardless of whether the proposed problem makes practical sense or not.

The lack of universal agreement reaches such a point that very few entities or individuals would dare, -as the International Monetary Fund has done,- to impose their criteria as unique, and consequently force the planet to blindly follow their recommendations, without measuring the consequences this may imply.

Indeed, we can demonstrate that the four basic recommendations that the IMF proposes to all countries of the world to ingratiate themselves with international capital lack scientific criteria, have a biased component aimed at benefiting the North American nation, and dangerously lead us to an unprecedented crisis in the international arena.

Here are the recommendations that all countries must execute (except the United States), according to IMF criteria:

1. Open economies to free market through tariff reduction.
2. Reduce fiscal deficit.
3. Raise interest rates.
4. Privatize public services, and control wage escalation.

If with the execution of the first recommendation countries enter crisis, they must continue with the following options, even if the supposed remedy is worse than the disease. Needless to say that although there is no consensus among different economic currents, one must move forward.

Let us then demonstrate the absurdity of the precepts in terms of scientific criteria, the inconvenience of their application, at least for other countries outside the North American sphere, and extrapolate a bit the fate we can expect from continuing this trend.

**LITTLE SCIENTIFIC CRITERIA**: When we talk about physical sciences or any of their application branches like engineering, or even when someone thinks about fixing any machine, the first thing we think of is analyzing the specific initial conditions of the subject to be able to issue a diagnosis and then give a concept about possible solutions, which do not necessarily have to be unique. A doctor for example, never gives a general remedy for all his patients, but analyzes each one in their own condition and in any way tries to save first of all the patient's life. Only the IMF has thought of tightening the belt of all its patients without caring if one more point would affect the working life of a nation, showing its intention to help not the countries in difficulty, but to ensure that big capital money is safe in those countries that manifest difficulties.

**CONVENIENCES and INCONVENIENCES**: It is of particular importance to determine how each of the cited recommendations influences the economy, and whom they benefit in general.

1. **Abolish tariffs.** Abolishing them indiscriminately, not gradually but suddenly has serious drawbacks. Although the measure is healthy and beneficial for world trade as deduced from theory, if other variables of the country's economy are not in their adequate "position", their effect can be equally sudden and harmful.

2. **Reduce fiscal deficit**. This, although apparently healthy, involves more an ignorance of the deep meaning that exists in economic theory regarding money generation and its relationship with a country's growth.

3. **Raise interest rates**. At this point there is a theoretical void, and if we are to be fair, the IMF should promote that rates be equalized internationally. But no. It asks for them to be raised, as if this were a scientific procedure.

4. **Privatize public services, and control wage escalation**. In principle nothing wrong. When private capital enters markets that are profitable, in principle they can provide better service, provided there is competition.

We must accept that economics, as a science, still lacks to complete a well-developed structure. But its application is full of deceptive assumptions, and why not say it, dangerous insofar as arguments can be manipulated to make them seem beneficial, when in reality particular interests are being defended that extrapolated can become harmful to a society, or perhaps, to the entire population.

Indeed, credits have a limit, circulating money issuance also has a limit, and interest rates also have one, as does unemployment. The interesting thing is that when one of them enters crisis, immediately the others begin to enter uncontrollable disturbances, and perhaps the system leads to an explosion of all these variables.

How, or how serious can a world crisis become, as it seems to be coming, apparently, without apparent remedy?

We cannot predict it. We know how terrible the crisis of the thirties was, and there is no way to know if it will be of that magnitude or worse. But we do glimpse it, thanks to knowledge of economic laws as we have mentioned.

However, the visionary Nostradamus describes the possible event in a terrifying way thus:

"The great scarcity that I feel approaching will repeat often to then become universal: so great will it be and of such long duration that they will eat roots and tear newborns from their mothers' breasts."

And in another century he says:

"Inflation will affect the simulacra of gold and silver, which after theft will be thrown into the lake, upon discovering that everything has been destroyed by debt. All titles and securities will be cancelled."

We have no dates, although the most probable according to researchers are around the year 2000. Nor is it in our field to know if it can be avoided, or if the gods would allow man to skip this stage, and if this were possible it would remain to be seen if the will of all men, with their passions and interests would be willing to sacrifice part of their postulates for the benefit of all humanity and perhaps their own survival on the planet, in peace, order, and harmony.
