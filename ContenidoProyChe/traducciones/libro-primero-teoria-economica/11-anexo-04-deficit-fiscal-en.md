## THE PROBLEM OF FISCAL DEFICIT

**By Mauricio Rivadeneira Mora**

To understand why fiscal deficit can become a problem it is necessary to understand how it relates to money generation in an economy.

Twenty years ago in Colombia there was not the same amount of money that exists today. Money, like production, grows year by year.

We all know, or at least intuit how the new increase in production of goods and services arises, but it is not clear where the new money comes from.

In primitive times of humanity barter worked, but not money. Later, metals replaced barter facilitating trade. Over time gold became more popular. Gold became the symbol of nations' wealth. Subsequently governments issued paper representative of the gold they acquired, thus arising paper money, and with it, gold reserves. Thus, money in circulation initially had its backing in gold. Money was born into circulation with "paper money" printed by governments in exchange for gold sold to them by seekers of the precious metal. The **gold standard** was imposed for money issuance.

Then, governments realized they did not need gold to issue money. They could simply issue it, and put it into circulation as payments to their employees and contractors. No gold backing or anything like that.

The excesses of this faculty to issue money and other inflation problems observed, erroneously assigned to the issuance phenomenon, forced countries like Colombia to abandon their primary faculty to issue their own money, giving it to the United States, perhaps involuntarily, by accepting the Dollar standard. Now the money issued has its backing in gold or dollars, unfortunately.

It is clear, as the economy is growing, or rather, as production is growing, more money in circulation is required, that is, money must also increase.

The economy itself does not care where the money comes from, as long as it increases. It does not matter if it comes from gold backing, or if it comes from currency exchange, or if it is simply primary issuance. In some way they are all issuance, and a bill with backing or without it has the same value in the market, besides being indifferent and unrecognizable. Simply all bills are equal, and have the same acceptance in the market.

Thus, the contribution that governments can make for adequate economic growth is the creation of new money that the market requires. Money that will necessarily penetrate as someone's income, either through payment for services rendered, or as payments to individuals for work performed, or as government credits to individuals. And since they are to finance growth, it is clear that resources will have to come from primary issuance, or from external credit or from export results, which will obviously also be monetized. But in essence, resources thus obtained are through a fiscal deficit, since these are government expenditures for which no available resource exists. Then, for an economy to grow healthily it is required that a budget deficit exists.

Indeed, the supply of new money that the system requires must be dosed by the government in such a way that prices tend to remain stable, as suggested by the quantitative equation of money, ($P.Q = M.V), where $P represents the price level, Q production, M the amount of money and V the velocity of money circulation.

Observing the equation, we can deduce that if $P and V remain constant, and Q is growing, to balance the effect it is required that M, the amount of money, also grows.

And the simplest and most economical way for M to grow is through government primary issuance, which in Colombia was suppressed by the new constitution, in my concept, an error that should be corrected.

However, that the government cannot make primary issuance does not mean that the new money the system requires cannot be supplied. Indeed, if for example exports exceed imports, the excess foreign currency will supply new money.

But if exports are not sufficient, external credit or foreign currency for investment can generate the new money required. But this has a problem, on one hand credits demand interest payments and credit repayment. That is, sooner or later that new money will have to be returned, and consequently it will be necessary to get a larger credit, and then another increasingly larger one, and we all know what happens to a person when they only have increasingly larger debts.

An additional problem to be able to supply new money when there is no primary issuance, is that credits requested by government and individuals are not sufficient, so interest rates will have to be raised to attract external foreign currency, which in turn will cause another problem, which is, raising the internal cost of money. And when costs rise, prices rise, and competitiveness is lost, and then we will need more money, and .... -we enter a vicious circle.

In conclusion, the healthiest way to supply new money to economies is through primary issuance, via fiscal deficit, and not through increase in reserves via external credits or "speculative investments", which will also represent a fiscal deficit. In synthesis, the problem is not the deficit, but the way chosen to finance this deficit.
